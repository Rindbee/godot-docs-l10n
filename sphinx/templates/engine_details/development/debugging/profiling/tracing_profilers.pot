msgid "Tracy is an Open Source profiler that runs on a wide variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. While it is primarily a tracing profiler, it can also periodically sample data like a :ref:`sampling profiler <doc_sampling_profilers>`, giving some of the benefits of both approaches."
