msgid "To get useful profiling information, it is **absolutely required** to use a Godot build that includes debugging symbols. Official binaries do not include debugging symbols, since these would make the download size significantly larger."

#: ../../docs/engine_details/development/debugging/profiling/sampling_profilers.rst:23
msgid "To get profiling data that best matches the production environment (but with debugging symbols), you should compile binaries with the ``production=yes debug_symbols=yes`` SCons options."

msgid "It is possible to run a profiler on less optimized builds (e.g. ``target=template_debug`` without LTO), but results will naturally be less representative of real world conditions."

msgid "If you're looking into optimizing Godot's startup/shutdown performance, you can tell the profiler to use the ``--quit`` command line option on the Godot binary. This will exit Godot just after it's done starting. The ``--quit`` option works with ``--editor``, ``--project-manager``, and ``--path <path to project directory>`` (which runs a project directly)."
