msgid "Variant is the most important datatype in Godot. A Variant takes up only 24 bytes on 64-bit platforms (20 bytes on 32-bit platforms) and can store almost any engine datatype inside of it. Variants are rarely used to hold information for long periods of time, instead they are used mainly for communication, editing, serialization and generally moving data around."
