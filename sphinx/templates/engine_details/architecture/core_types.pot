msgid "Godot uses the standard C99 datatypes, such as ``uint8_t``, ``uint32_t``, ``int64_t``, etc. which are nowadays supported by every compiler. Reinventing the wheel for those is not fun, as it makes code more difficult to read."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/engine_details/architecture/core_types.rst:20
msgid "In general, care is not taken to use the most efficient datatype for a given task unless using large structures or arrays. ``int`` is used through most of the code unless necessary. This is done because nowadays every device has at least a 32-bit bus and can do such operations in one cycle. It makes code more readable too."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/engine_details/architecture/core_types.rst:39
msgid "PC is a wonderful architecture. Computers often have gigabytes of RAM, terabytes of storage and gigahertz of CPU, and when an application needs more resources the OS will swap out the inactive ones. Other architectures (like mobile or consoles) are in general more limited."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/engine_details/architecture/core_types.rst:44
msgid "The most common memory model is the heap, where an application will request a region of memory, and the underlying OS will try to fit it somewhere and return it. This often works best and is flexible, but over time and with abuse, this can lead to segmentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/engine_details/architecture/core_types.rst:49
msgid "Segmentation slowly creates holes that are too small for most common allocations, so that memory is wasted. There is a lot of literature about heap and segmentation, so this topic will not be developed further here. Modern operating systems use paged memory, which helps mitigate the problem of segmentation but doesn't solve it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/engine_details/architecture/core_types.rst:55
msgid "However, in many studies and tests, it is shown that given enough memory, if the maximum allocation size is below a given threshold in proportion to the maximum heap size and proportion of memory intended to be unused, segmentation will not be a problem over time as it will remain constant. In other words, leave 10-20% of your memory free and perform all small allocations and you are fine."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/engine_details/architecture/core_types.rst:62
msgid "Godot ensures that all objects that can be allocated dynamically are small (less than a few kB at most). But what happens if an allocation is too large (like an image or mesh geometry or large array)? In this case Godot has the option to use a dynamic memory pool. This memory needs to be locked to be accessed, and if an allocation runs out of memory, the pool will be rearranged and compacted on demand. Depending on the need of the game, the programmer can configure the dynamic memory pool size."

msgid "For C-style allocation, Godot provides a few macros:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/engine_details/architecture/core_types.rst:104
msgid "For dynamic memory, use one of Godot's sequence types such as ``Vector<>`` or ``LocalVector<>``. ``Vector<>`` behaves much like an STL ``std::vector<>``, but is simpler and uses Copy-On-Write (CoW) semantics. CoW copies of ``Vector<>`` can safely access the same data from different threads, but several threads cannot access the same ``Vector<>`` instance safely. It can be safely passed via public API if it has a ``Packed`` alias."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/engine_details/architecture/core_types.rst:111
msgid "The ``Packed*Array`` :ref:`types <doc_gdscript_packed_arrays>` are aliases for specific ``Vector<*>`` types (e.g., ``PackedByteArray``, ``PackedInt32Array``) that are accessible via GDScript. Outside of core, prefer using the ``Packed*Array`` aliases for functions exposed to scripts, and ``Vector<>`` for other occasions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/engine_details/architecture/core_types.rst:117
msgid "``LocalVector<>`` is much more like ``std::vector`` than ``Vector<>``. It is non-CoW, with less overhead. It is intended for internal use where the benefits of CoW are not needed. Note that neither ``LocalVector<>`` nor ``Vector<>`` are drop-in replacements for each other. They are two unrelated types with similar interfaces, both using a buffer as their storage strategy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/engine_details/architecture/core_types.rst:124
msgid "``List<>`` is another Godot sequence type, using a doubly-linked list as its storage strategy. Prefer ``Vector<>`` (or ``LocalVector<>``) over ``List<>`` unless you're sure you need it, as cache locality and memory fragmentation tend to be more important with small collections."
