The engine integrates the `doctest <https://github.com/doctest/doctest>`_ unit testing framework which gives ability to write test suites and test cases next to production code, but since the tests in Godot go through a different ``main`` entry point, the tests reside in a dedicated ``tests/`` directory instead, which is located at the root of the engine source code."
