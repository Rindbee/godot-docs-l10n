msgid "So you've added a new parameter to a method, changed the return type, changed the type of a parameter, or changed its default value, and now the automated testing is complaining about compatibility breakages?"

msgid "They should start with a ``_`` to indicate that they are internal, and end with ``_bind_compat_`` followed by the PR number that introduced the change (``88047`` in this example). These compatibility methods need to be implemented in a dedicated file, like ``core/math/a_star_grid_2d.compat.inc`` in this case:"

msgid "Unless the change in compatibility is complex, the compatibility method should simply call the modified method directly, instead of duplicating that method. Make sure to match the default arguments for that method (in the example above this would be ``false``)."

msgid "This file should always be placed next to the original file, and have ``.compat.inc`` at the end instead of ``.cpp`` or ``.h``. Next, this should be included in the ``.cpp`` file we're adding compatibility methods to, so ``core/math/a_star_grid_2d.cpp``:"
