msgid "Once you're satisfied with the icon's design, save the icon in the cloned repository's ``editor/icons`` folder. The icon name should match the intended name in a case-sensitive manner. For example, to create an icon for CPUParticles2D, name the file ``CPUParticles2D.svg``."

msgid "If the user has configured their editor to use a light theme, Godot will convert the icon's colors based on a `set of predefined color mappings <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/editor/themes/editor_color_map.cpp>`__. This is to ensure the icon always displays with a sufficient contrast rate. Try to restrict your icon's color palette to colors found in the list above. Otherwise, your icon may become difficult to read on a light background."

msgid "Icon optimization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/contributing/development/editor/creating_icons.rst:49
msgid "Because the editor renders SVGs once at load time, they need to be small in size so they can be efficiently parsed. When the :ref:`pre-commit hook <doc_code_style_guidelines_pre_commit_hook>` runs, it automatically optimizes the SVG using `svgo <https://github.com/svg/svgo>`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/contributing/development/editor/creating_icons.rst:56
msgid "While this optimization step won't impact the icon's quality noticeably, it will still remove editor-only information such as guides. Therefore, it's recommended to keep the source SVG around if you need to make further changes."

msgid "It's also possible to create custom icons within a module. If you're creating your own module and don't plan to integrate it with Godot, you don't need to make a separate pull request for your icons to be available within the editor as they can be self-contained."
