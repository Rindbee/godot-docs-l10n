#: ../../docs/contributing/workflow/first_steps.rst:20
msgid "Your own code will be reviewed and improved by other developers, and will be further maintained directly in the upstream project, so you won't have to reapply your own changes every time you move to a newer version. On the other hand it comes with a responsibility, as your changes have to be generic enough to be beneficial to all users, and not just your project; so in some cases it might still be relevant to keep your changes only for your own project, if they are too specific."

Depending on the scope of the changes, it may take some time for a maintainer responsible for the modified part of the engine to provide their review. We value all of our contributors and ask them to be patient in the meantime, as it is expected that in an open source project like Godot, there is going to be way more contributions than people validating them."

msgid "To make sure that your time and efforts aren't wasted, it is recommended to vet the idea first before implementing it and putting it for a review as a PR. To that end, Godot has a `proposal system <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals>`_. Its usage is encouraged to plan changes and discuss them with the community. Implementation details can also be discussed with other contributors on the `Godot Contributors Chat <https://chat.godotengine.org/>`_."
