msgid "In case the player presses, say, both W and D simultaneously, the vector will have a length of about ``1.4``. But if they press a single key, it will have a length of ``1``. We want the vector's length to be consistent, and not move faster diagonally. To do so, we can call its ``normalized()`` method."

msgid "On the last line, we call ``CharacterBody3D.move_and_slide()`` which is a powerful method of the ``CharacterBody3D`` class that allows you to move a character smoothly.
