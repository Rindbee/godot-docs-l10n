msgid "We want to detect being hit by an enemy differently from squashing them. We want the player to die when they're moving on the floor, but not if they're in the air. We could use vector math to distinguish the two kinds of collisions. Instead, though, we will use an :ref:`Area3D <class_Area3D>` node, which works well for hitboxes."
