#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:13
msgid "To make supporting multiple platforms easier, Godot uses **UNIX-style path separators** (forward slash ``/``). These work on all platforms, **including Windows**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:17
msgid "Instead of writing paths like ``C:\\Projects\\Game``, in Godot, you should write ``C:/Projects/Game``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:20
msgid "Windows-style path separators (backward slash ``\\``) are also supported in some path-related methods, but they need to be doubled (``\\\\``), as ``\\`` is normally used as an escape for characters with a special meaning."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:24

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:60
msgid "To store persistent data files, like the player's save or settings, you want to use ``user://`` instead of ``res://`` as your path's prefix. This is because when the game is running, the project's file system will likely be read-only."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:64
