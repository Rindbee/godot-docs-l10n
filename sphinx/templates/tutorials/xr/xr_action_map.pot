msgid "Godot has an action map feature as part of the XR system. At this point in time this system is part of the OpenXR module. There are plans to encompass WebXR into this in the near future hence we call it the XR action map system in this document. It implements the built-in action map system of OpenXR mostly exactly as it is offered."

msgid "Godot's built-in input system has many things in common with the XR action map system. In fact our original idea was to add functionality to the existing input system and expose the data to the OpenXR action map system. We may revisit that idea at some point but as it turns out there were just too many problems to overcome. To name a few:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/xr/xr_action_map.rst:34
msgid "Godot's input system mainly centers around button inputs, XR adds triggers, axis, poses and haptics (output) into the mix. This would greatly complicate the input system with features that won't work for normal controllers or contrast with the current approach. It was felt this would lead to confusion for the majority of Godot users."

msgid "Godot's input system works with raw input data that is parsed and triggers emitting actions. This input data is made available to the end user. OpenXR completely hides raw data and does all the parsing for us, we only get access to already parsed action data.

As a result this map essentially binds all known inputs on all controllers supported by default, to actions one on one. This is not a good example of setting up an action map. It does allow a new developer to have a starting point when they want to become familiar with Godot XR. It prevents having to design a proper action map for their game/application first."
