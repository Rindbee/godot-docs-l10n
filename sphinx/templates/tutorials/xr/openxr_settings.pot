There are however different scenarios that place this point in different locations, depending on the XR system used. In OpenXR these scenarios are well defined and selected by setting a reference space."

The user recentering in this scenario can be unpredictable unless you counter the move when handling the recenter signal. This can even be game breaking as the effect in this scenario would be the player teleporting to whatever abstract location the origin point was placed at during virtual movement, including the ability for players teleporting into locations that should be off limits. It is better to use the Stage mode in this scenario and limit resetting to orientation only when a ``pose_recentered`` signal is received."
