msgid "Shadow to opacity is a render mode for Godot spatial shaders that was introduced in Godot 3 specifically for AR. It is a special render mode where the more a surface is in shadow, the more opaque the surface becomes. When a surface is fully lit, the surface becomes fully transparent and thus shows the real world."
