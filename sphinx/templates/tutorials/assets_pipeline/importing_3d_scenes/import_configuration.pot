msgid "Godot provides several ways to customize the imported data, such as the import dock, the advanced import setting dialog, and inherited scenes. This can be used to make further changes to the imported scene, such as adjusting meshes, adding physics information, and adding new nodes. You can also write a script that runs code at the end of the import process to perform arbitrary customization."
