msgid "If you do not want Godot to perform any of the actions described below, you can set the ``nodes/use_node_type_suffixes`` import option to ``false``. This will disable all node type suffixes, which keeps nodes the same type as the original file indicated. However, the ``-noimp`` suffix will still be respected, as well as non-node suffixes like ``-vcol`` or ``-loop``."

msgid "Alternatively, you can completely opt out of all name suffixes by setting the ``nodes/use_name_suffixes`` import option to ``false``. This will completely stop the general scene import code from looking at name suffixes. However, the format-specific import code may still look at name suffixes, such as the glTF importer checking for the ``-loop`` suffix."

msgid "The option ``-col`` will work only for Mesh objects. If it is detected, a child static collision node will be added, using the same geometry as the mesh. This will create a triangle mesh collision shape, which is a slow, but accurate option for collision detection. This option is usually what you want for level geometry (but see also ``-colonly`` below)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The option ``-convcol`` will create a :ref:`class_ConvexPolygonShape3D` instead of a :ref:`class_ConcavePolygonShape3D`. Unlike triangle meshes which can be concave, a convex shape can only accurately represent a shape that doesn't have any concave angles (a pyramid is convex, but a hollow box is concave). Due to this, convex collision shapes are generally not suited for level geometry. When representing simple enough meshes, convex collision shapes can result in better performance compared to a triangle collision shape. This option is ideal for simple or dynamic objects that require mostly-accurate collision detection."
