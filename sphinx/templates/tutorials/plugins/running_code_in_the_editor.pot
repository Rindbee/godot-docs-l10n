msgid "``@tool`` scripts run inside the editor, and let you access the scene tree of the currently edited scene. This is a powerful feature which also comes with caveats, as the editor does not include protections for potential misuse of ``@tool`` scripts. Be **extremely** cautious when manipulating the scene tree, especially via :ref:`Node.queue_free<class_Node_method_queue_free>`, as it can cause crashes if you free a node while the editor runs logic involving it."

msgid "The general rule is that **any other GDScript that your tool script uses must *also* be a tool**. The editor is not able to construct instances from GDScript files without ``@tool``, which means you cannot call methods or reference member variables from them otherwise. However, since static methods, constants and enums can be used without creating an instance, it is possible to call them or reference them from a ``@tool`` script onto other non-tool scripts. One exception to this are :ref:`static variables <doc_gdscript_basics_static_variables>`. If you try to read a static variable's value in a script that does not have ``@tool``, it will always return ``null`` but won't print a warning or error when doing so. This restriction does not apply to static methods, which can be called regardless of whether the target script is in tool mode."

msgid "Extending a ``@tool`` script does not automatically make the extending script a ``@tool``. Omitting ``@tool`` from the extending script will disable tool behavior from the super class. Therefore, the extending script should also specify the ``@tool`` annotation."

msgid "Modifications in the editor are permanent, with no undo/redo possible. For example, in the next section when we remove the script, the node will keep its rotation. Be careful to avoid making unwanted modifications. Consider setting up :ref:`version control <doc_version_control_systems>` to avoid losing work in case you make a mistake."
