msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/plugins/running_code_in_the_editor.rst:9
msgid "``@tool`` is a powerful line of code that, when added at the top of your script, makes it execute in the editor. You can also decide which parts of the script execute in the editor, which in game, and which in both."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can use it for doing many things, but it is mostly useful in level design for visually presenting things that are hard to predict ourselves. Here are some use cases:"

msgid "If you have a cannon that shoots cannonballs affected by physics (gravity), you can draw the cannonball's trajectory in the editor, making level design a lot easier."

msgid "If you have jumppads with varying jump heights, you can draw the maximum jump height a player would reach if it jumped on one, also making level design easier."
msgstr ""

msgid "If your player doesn't use a sprite, but draws itself using code, you can make that drawing code execute in the editor to see your player."

msgid "``@tool`` scripts run inside the editor, and let you access the scene tree of the currently edited scene. This is a powerful feature which also comes with caveats, as the editor does not include protections for potential misuse of ``@tool`` scripts. Be **extremely** cautious when manipulating the scene tree, especially via :ref:`Node.queue_free<class_Node_method_queue_free>`, as it can cause crashes if you free a node while the editor runs logic involving it."

msgid "Extending a ``@tool`` script does not automatically make the extending script a ``@tool``. Omitting ``@tool`` from the extending script will disable tool behavior from the super class. Therefore the extending script should also specify the ``@tool`` annotation."
