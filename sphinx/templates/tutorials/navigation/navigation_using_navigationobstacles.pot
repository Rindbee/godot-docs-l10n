msgid "An obstacle does not add geometry in the baking process, it only removes geometry. It does so by nullifying all the (voxel) cells with rasterized source geometry that are within the obstacle shape. As such its effect and shape detail is limited to the cell resolution used by the baking process."

msgid "The ``carve_navigation_mesh`` property makes the shape unaffected by offsets of the baking, e.g. the offset added by the navigation mesh ``agent_radius``. It will basically act as a stencil and cut into the already offset navigation mesh surface. It will still be affected by further postprocessing of the baking process like edge simplification."

msgid "When baking navigation meshes in scripts obstacles can be added procedurally as a projected obstruction. Obstacles are not involved in the source geometry parsing so adding them just before baking is enough."

msgid "When the 2D avoidance is used in 3D the y-axis of Vector3 vertices is ignored. Instead, the global y-axis position of the obstacle is used as the elevation level. Agents will ignore static obstacles in 3D that are below or above them.

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationobstacles.rst:186
msgid "While both static and dynamic properties can be active at the same time on the same obstacle this is not recommended for performance. Ideally when an obstacle is moving the static vertices are removed and instead the radius activated. When the obstacle reaches the new final position it should gradually enlarge its radius to push all other agents away. With enough created safe space around the obstacle it should add the static vertices again and remove the radius. This helps avoid getting agents stuck in the suddenly appearing static obstacle when the rebuilt static boundary is finished."
