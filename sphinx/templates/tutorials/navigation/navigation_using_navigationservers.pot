msgid "To reference the internal NavigationServer objects like maps, regions and agents RIDs are used as identification numbers. Every navigation related node in the scene tree has a function that returns the RID for this node."

msgid "Threading and Synchronization"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationservers.rst:21
msgid "The NavigationServer does not update every change immediately but waits until the end of the **physics frame** to synchronize all the changes together."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationservers.rst:24
msgid "Waiting for synchronization is required to apply changes to all maps, regions and agents. Synchronization is done because some updates like a recalculation of the entire navigation map are very expensive and require updated data from all other objects. Also the NavigationServer uses a **threadpool** by default for some functionality like avoidance calculation between agents."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationservers.rst:28
msgid "Waiting is not required for most ``get()`` functions that only request data from the NavigationServer without making changes. Note that not all data will account for changes made in the same frame. E.g. if an avoidance agent changed the navigation map this frame the ``agent_get_map()`` function will still return the old map before the synchronization. The exception to this are nodes that store their values internally before sending the update to the NavigationServer. When a getter on a node is used for a value that was updated in the same frame it will return the already updated value stored on the node."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationservers.rst:34
msgid "The NavigationServer is **thread-safe** as it places all API calls that want to make changes in a queue to be executed in the synchronization phase. Synchronization for the NavigationServer happens in the middle of the physics frame after scene input from scripts and nodes are all done."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationservers.rst:38
msgid "The important takeaway is that most NavigationServer changes take effect after the next physics frame and not immediately. This includes all changes made by navigation related nodes in the scene tree or through scripts."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationservers.rst:59
msgid "The navigation map is still empty or not updated at this point. All nodes from the scene tree need to first upload their navigation related data to the NavigationServer. Each added or changed map, region or agent need to be registered with the NavigationServer. Afterward the NavigationServer requires a **physics frame** for synchronization to update the maps, regions and agents."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_using_navigationservers.rst:64
msgid "One workaround is to make a deferred call to a custom setup function (so all nodes are ready). The setup function makes all the navigation changes, e.g. adding procedural stuff. Afterwards the function waits for the next physics frame before continuing with path queries."
