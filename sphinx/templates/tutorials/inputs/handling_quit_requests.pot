msgid "There is no direct equivalent to ``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` on mobile platforms. Due to the nature of mobile operating systems, the only place that you can run code prior to quitting is when the app is being suspended to the background. On both Android and iOS, the app can be killed while suspended at any time by either the user or the OS. A way to plan ahead for this possibility is to utilize ``NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_PAUSED`` in order to perform any needed actions as the app is being suspended."

Quitting by calling :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` will not allow custom actions to complete (such as saving, confirming the quit, or debugging), even if you try to delay the line that forces the quit."
