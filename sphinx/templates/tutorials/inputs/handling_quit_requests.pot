msgid "There is no direct equivalent to ``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` on mobile platforms. Due to the nature of mobile operating systems, the only place that you can run code prior to quitting is when the app is being suspended to the background. On both Android and iOS, the app can be killed while suspended at any time by either the user or the OS. A way to plan ahead for this possibility is to utilize ``NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_PAUSED`` in order to perform any needed actions as the app is being suspended."

msgid "On iOS, you only have approximately 5 seconds to finish a task started by this signal. If you go over this allotment, iOS will kill the app instead of pausing it."

msgid "While forcing the application to close can be done by calling :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>`, doing so will not send the ``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` to the nodes in the scene tree. Quitting by calling :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` will not allow custom actions to complete (such as saving, confirming the quit, or debugging), even if you try to delay the line that forces the quit."

msgid "Sending this notification will inform all nodes about the program termination, but will not terminate the program itself *unlike in 3.X*. In order to achieve the previous behavior, :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` should be called after the notification."
