msgid "Since Godot 4.5, the engine relies on `SDL 3 <https://www.libsdl.org/index.php>`__ for controller support on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This means the list of supported controllers and their behavior should closely match what is available in other games and engines using SDL 3. Note that SDL is only used for input, not for windowing or sound."

msgid "Prior to Godot 4.5, the engine used its own controller support code. This can cause certain controllers to behave incorrectly. This custom code is still used to support controllers on Android, iOS, and Web, so it may result in issues appearing only on those platforms."

msgid "Unlike keyboards and mice, controllers offer axes with *analog* inputs. The upside of analog inputs is that they offer additional flexibility for actions. Unlike digital inputs which can only provide strengths of ``0.0`` and ``1.0``, an analog input can provide *any* strength between ``0.0`` and ``1.0``. The downside is that without a deadzone system, an analog axis' strength will never be equal to ``0.0`` due to how the controller is physically built. Instead, it will linger at a low value such as ``0.062``. This phenomenon is known as *drifting* and can be more noticeable on old or faulty controllers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/controllers_gamepads_joysticks.rst:192
msgid "Let's take a racing game as a real-world example. Thanks to analog inputs, we can steer the car slowly in one direction or another. However, without a deadzone system, the car would slowly steer by itself even if the player isn't touching the joystick. This is because the directional axis strength won't be equal to ``0.0`` when we expect it to. Since we don't want our car to steer by itself in this case, we define a \"dead zone\" value of ``0.2`` which will ignore all input whose strength is lower than ``0.2``. An ideal dead zone value is high enough to ignore the input caused by joystick drifting, but is low enough to not ignore actual input from the player."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/controllers_gamepads_joysticks.rst:202
msgid "Godot features a built-in deadzone system to tackle this problem. The default value is ``0.5``, but you can adjust it on a per-action basis in the Project Settings' Input Map tab. For ``Input.get_vector()``, the deadzone can be specified as an optional 5th parameter. If not specified, it will calculate the average deadzone value from all of the actions in the vector."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/inputs/controllers_gamepads_joysticks.rst:216
msgid "If you want controller buttons to send echo events, you will have to generate :ref:`class_InputEvent` objects by code and parse them using :ref:`Input.parse_input_event() <class_Input_method_parse_input_event>` at regular intervals.

For instance, Xbox One and Xbox Series controllers can have their firmware updated using the `Xbox Accessories app <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-accessories/9nblggh30xj3>`__. (This application only runs on Windows, so you have to use a Windows machine or a Windows virtual machine with USB support to update the controller's firmware.)

In this case, you will need to create a custom mapping for your controller."
