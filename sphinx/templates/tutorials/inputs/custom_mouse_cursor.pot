msgid "You could display a \"software\" mouse cursor by hiding the mouse cursor and moving a Sprite2D to the cursor position in a ``_process()`` method, but this will add at least one frame of latency compared to a \"hardware\" mouse cursor. Therefore, it's recommended to use the approach described here whenever possible."
