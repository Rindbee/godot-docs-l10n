msgid "Godot comes with a large set of built-in features. While this is convenient, this also means its binary size is larger than it could be, especially for projects that only use a small portion of its feature set."

msgid "To help reduce binary size, it is possible to compile custom export templates with certain features disabled. This is described in detail in :ref:`doc_optimizing_for_size`. However, determining which features need to be disabled can be a tedious task. The engine compilation configuration editor aims to address this by providing an interface to view and manage these features easily, while also being able to detect the features currently being used in the project."

msgid "Use the :button:`Detect from Project` button to automatically detect features currently used in the project and disable unused features. Note that this will override the existing list of features, so if you have manually unchecked some items, their state will be reset based on whether the project actually uses the feature."

msgid "Unchecking features in this dialog will not reduce binary size directly on export. Since it is only possible to actually remove features from the binary at compile-time, you still need to compile custom export templates with the build profile specified to actually benefit from the engine compilation configuration editor."

msgid "You can now save the build profile by clicking **Save As** at the top. The build profile can be saved in any location, but it's a good idea to save it somewhere in your project folder and add it to version control to be able to go back to it later when needed. This also allows using version control to track changes to the build profile."
