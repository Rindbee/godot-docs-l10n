msgid "There are dozens of settings you can change to control a project's execution, including physics, rendering, and windowing settings. These settings can be changed from the **Project Settings** window, from code, or by manually editing the ``project.godot`` file. You can see a full list of settings in the :ref:`ProjectSettings <class_ProjectSettings>` class."

msgid "Internally, Godot stores the settings for a project in a ``project.godot`` file, a plain text file in INI format. While this is human-readable and version control friendly, it's not the most convenient to edit. For that reason, the **Project Settings** window is available to edit these settings. To open the Project Settings, select **Project > Project Settings** from the main menu."

Usage of these other tabs is documented elsewhere."

msgid "The **General** tab of the project settings window works much like the inspector. It displays a list of project settings which you can change, just like inspector properties. There is a list of categories on the left, which you can use to select related groups of settings. You can also search for a specific setting with the **Filter Settings** field."
