msgid "The properties in this material control how particles behave and change over their lifetime. A lot of them have ``Min``, ``Max``, and ``Curve`` values that allow you to fine-tune their behavior. The relationship between these values is this: When a particle is spawned, the property is set with a random value between ``Min`` and ``Max``. If ``Min`` and ``Max`` are the same, the value will always be the same for every particle. If the ``Curve`` is also set, the value of the property will be multiplied by the value of the curve at the current point in a particle's lifetime. Use the curve to change a property over the particle lifetime. Very complex behavior can be expressed this way."

A value of ``0`` means there is no randomness at all and all particles live for the same amount of time, set by the :ref:`Lifetime <doc_3d_particles_properties_time>` property. A value of ``1`` means that a particle's lifetime is completely random within the range of [0.0, ``Lifetime``]."
