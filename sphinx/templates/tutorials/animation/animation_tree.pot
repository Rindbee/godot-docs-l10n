msgid "With :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>`, Godot has one of the most flexible animation systems that you can find in any game engine. It is pretty much unique in its ability to animate almost any property in any node or resource, and its dedicated transform, bezier, function calling, audio, and sub-animation tracks."

msgid "However, the support for blending those animations via ``AnimationPlayer`` is limited, as you can only set a fixed cross-fade transition time."

msgid ":ref:`AnimationTree <class_AnimationTree>` is a new node introduced in Godot 3.1 to deal with advanced transitions. It replaces the ancient ``AnimationTreePlayer``, while adding a huge amount of features and flexibility."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:21
msgid "Before starting, know that an ``AnimationTree`` node does not contain its own animations. Instead, it uses animations contained in an ``AnimationPlayer`` node. You create, edit, or import your animations in an ``AnimationPlayer`` and then use an ``AnimationTree`` to control the playback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:25
msgid "``AnimationPlayer`` and ``AnimationTree`` can be used in both 2D and 3D scenes. When importing 3D scenes and their animations, you can use `name suffixes <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_3d_scenes/node_type_customization.html#animation-loop-loop-cycle>`_ to simplify the process and import with the correct properties. At the end, the imported Godot scene will contain the animations in an ``AnimationPlayer`` node. Since you rarely use imported scenes directly in Godot (they are either instantiated or inherited from), you can place the ``AnimationTree`` node in your new scene which contains the imported one. Afterwards, point the ``AnimationTree`` node to the ``AnimationPlayer`` that was created in the imported scene."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:243
msgid "Advance Condition is a true/false check. You may put a custom variable name in the text field, and when the StateMachine reaches this transition, it will check if your variable is *true*. If so, the transition continues. Note that the advance condition **only** checks if a variable is *true*, and it cannot check for falseness."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:247
msgid "This gives the Advance Condition a very limited capability. If you wanted to make a transition back and forth based on one property, you would need to make 2 variables that have opposite values, and check if either of them are true. This is why, in Godot 4, the Advance Expression was added."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:250
msgid "The Advance Expression works similar to the Advance Condition, but instead of checking if one variable is true, it evaluates any expression. An expression is anything you could put in an ``if`` statement. These are all examples of expressions that would work in the Advance Expression:"

msgid "StateMachine travel"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:283
msgid "One of the nice features in Godot's ``StateMachine`` implementation is the ability to travel. You can instruct the graph to go from the current state to another one, while visiting all the intermediate ones. This is done via the A\\* algorithm. If there is no path of transitions starting at the current state and finishing at the destination state, the graph teleports to the destination state."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:287

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:317
msgid "Finally, you may also change the blend mode. By default, blending happens by interpolating points inside the closest triangle. When dealing with 2D animations (frame by frame), you may want to switch to *Discrete* mode. Alternatively, if you want to keep the current play position when switching between discrete animations, there is a *Carry* mode. This mode can be changed in the *Blend* menu:"

msgid "For better blending"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:330
msgid "In Godot 4.0+, in order for the blending results to be deterministic (reproducible and always consistent), the blended property values must have a specific initial value. For example, in the case of two animations to be blended, if one animation has a property track and the other does not, the blended animation is calculated as if the latter animation had a property track with the initial value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:335
msgid "When using Position/Rotation/Scale 3D tracks for Skeleton3D bones, the initial value is Bone Rest. For other properties, the initial value is ``0`` and if the track is present in the ``RESET`` animation, the value of its first keyframe is used instead."

msgid "For example, the following AnimationPlayer has two animations, but one of them lacks a Property track for Position."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:343
msgid "This means that the animation lacking that will treat those Positions as ``Vector2(0, 0)``."
msgstr ""

msgid "This problem can be solved by adding a Property track for Position as an initial value to the ``RESET`` animation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:353
msgid "Be aware that the ``RESET`` animation exists to define the default pose when loading an object originally. It is assumed to have only one frame and is not expected to be played back using the timeline."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:356
msgid "Also keep in mind that the Rotation 3D tracks and the Property tracks for 2D rotation with Interpolation Type set to Linear Angle or Cubic Angle will prevent rotations greater than 180 degrees from the initial value as blended animation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:360
msgid "This can be useful for Skeleton3Ds to prevent the bones penetrating the body when blending animations. Therefore, Skeleton3D's Bone Rest values should be as close to the midpoint of the movable range as possible. **This means that for humanoid models, it is preferable to import them in a T-pose**."

msgid "Root motion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:373
msgid "When working with 3D animations, a popular technique is for animators to use the root skeleton bone to give motion to the rest of the skeleton. This allows animating characters in a way where steps actually match the floor below. It also allows precise interaction with objects during cinematics."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:376
msgid "When playing back the animation in Godot, it is possible to select this bone as the *root motion track*. Doing so will cancel the bone transformation visually (the animation will stay in place)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:420
msgid "Keep in mind that the animation nodes are just resources, so they are shared between all instances using them. Setting values in the nodes directly will affect all instances of the scene that uses this ``AnimationTree``.
