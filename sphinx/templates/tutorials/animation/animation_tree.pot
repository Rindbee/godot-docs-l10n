msgid "With :ref:`AnimationPlayer <class_AnimationPlayer>`, Godot has one of the most flexible animation systems that you can find in any game engine. It is pretty much unique in its ability to animate almost any property in any node or resource, and its dedicated transform, bezier, function calling, audio, and sub-animation tracks."

msgid "However, the support for blending those animations via ``AnimationPlayer`` is limited, as you can only set a fixed cross-fade transition time."

msgid ":ref:`AnimationTree <class_AnimationTree>` is a new node introduced in Godot 3.1 to deal with advanced transitions. It replaces the ancient ``AnimationTreePlayer``, while adding a huge amount of features and flexibility."

msgid "Before starting, know that an ``AnimationTree`` node does not contain its own animations. Instead, it uses animations contained in an ``AnimationPlayer`` node. You create, edit, or import your animations in an ``AnimationPlayer`` and then use an ``AnimationTree`` to control the playback."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:25
msgid "``AnimationPlayer`` and ``AnimationTree`` can be used in both 2D and 3D scenes. When importing 3D scenes and their animations, you can use `name suffixes <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/assets_pipeline/importing_3d_scenes/node_type_customization.html#animation-loop-loop-cycle>`_ to simplify the process and import with the correct properties. At the end, the imported Godot scene will contain the animations in an ``AnimationPlayer`` node. Since you rarely use imported scenes directly in Godot (they are either instantiated or inherited from), you can place the ``AnimationTree`` node in your new scene which contains the imported one. Afterwards, point the ``AnimationTree`` node to the ``AnimationPlayer`` that was created in the imported scene."

msgid "Advance Condition is a true/false check. You may put a custom variable name in the text field, and when the StateMachine reaches this transition, it will check if your variable is *true*.

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:247
msgid "This gives the Advance Condition a very limited capability. If you wanted to make a transition back and forth based on one property, you would need to make 2 variables that have opposite values, and check if either of them are true. This is why, in Godot 4, the Advance Expression was added."
msgstr ""

Alternatively, if you want to keep the current play position when switching between discrete animations, there is a *Carry* mode. This mode can be changed in the *Blend* menu:"

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:330
msgid "In Godot 4.0+, in order for the blending results to be deterministic (reproducible and always consistent), the blended property values must have a specific initial value. For example, in the case of two animations to be blended, if one animation has a property track and the other does not, the blended animation is calculated as if the latter animation had a property track with the initial value."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:356
msgid "Also keep in mind that the Rotation 3D tracks and the Property tracks for 2D rotation with Interpolation Type set to Linear Angle or Cubic Angle will prevent rotations greater than 180 degrees from the initial value as blended animation."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.rst:373
msgid "When working with 3D animations, a popular technique is for animators to use the root skeleton bone to give motion to the rest of the skeleton. This allows animating characters in a way where steps actually match the floor below. It also allows precise interaction with objects during cinematics."
msgstr ""
