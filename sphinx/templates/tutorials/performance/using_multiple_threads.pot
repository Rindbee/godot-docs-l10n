msgid "Your function will, then, run in a separate thread until it returns. Even if the function has returned already, the thread must collect it, so call :ref:`Thread.wait_to_finish()<class_Thread_method_wait_to_finish>`, which will wait until the thread is done (if not done yet), then properly dispose of it."

msgid "Creating threads is a slow operation, especially on Windows. To avoid unnecessary performance overhead, make sure to create threads before heavy processing is needed instead of creating threads just-in-time."

msgid "When processing your own data or calling your own functions, as a rule, try to avoid accessing the same data directly from different threads. You may run into synchronization problems, as the data is not always updated between CPU cores when modified. Always use a :ref:`Mutex<class_Mutex>` when accessing a piece of data from different threads."

msgid "When calling :ref:`Mutex.lock()<class_Mutex_method_lock>`, a thread ensures that all other threads will be blocked (put on suspended state) if they try to *lock* the same mutex. When the mutex is unlocked by calling :ref:`Mutex.unlock()<class_Mutex_method_unlock>`, the other threads will be allowed to proceed with the lock (but only one at a time)."
