msgid "These don't make sense in Godot core itself so Godot has long provided an :ref:`Android plugin system <doc_android_plugin>`. The :ref:`Android plugin system <doc_android_plugin>` enables developers to create Godot Android plugins using Java or Kotlin code, which provides an interface to access and use Android APIs or third-party libraries in Godot projects from GDScript, C# or GDExtension."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/platform/android/javaclasswrapper_and_androidruntimeplugin.rst:23
msgid "Writing an Android plugin however requires knowledge of Java or Kotlin code, which most Godot developers do not have. As such there are many Android APIs and third-party libraries that don't have a Godot plugin that developers can interface with. In fact, this is one of the main reasons that developers cite for not being able to switch to Godot from other game engines."

msgid "In the code snippet above, ``JavaClassWrapper`` is used from GDScript to access the Java ``LocalDateTime`` and ``DateTimeFormatter`` classes. Through ``JavaClassWrapper``, we can call the Java classes methods directly from GDScript as if they were GDScript methods."

msgid "``JavaClassWrapper`` is great, but to do many things on Android, you need access to various Android lifecycle / runtime objects. ``AndroidRuntime`` plugin is a `built-in Godot Android plugin <https://javadoc.io/doc/org.godotengine/godot/latest/org/godotengine/godot/plugin/AndroidRuntimePlugin.html>`_ that allows you to do this."

msgid "For exports using ``gradle``, Godot will automatically include ``.jar`` or ``.aar`` files it find in the project ``addons`` directory. So to use a third-party library, you can just drop its ``.jar`` or ``.aar`` file in the ``addons`` directory, and call its method directly from GDScript using ``JavaClassWrapper``."
