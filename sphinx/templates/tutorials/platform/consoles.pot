msgid "In order to develop for consoles in Godot, you need access to the console SDK and export templates for it. These export templates need to be developed either by yourself or someone hired to do it, or provided by a third-party company."

msgid "Currently, the only console Godot officially supports is Steam Deck (through the official Linux export templates)."

msgid "The reasons other consoles are not officially supported are the risks of legal liability, disproportionate cost, and open source licensing issues. The reasons are explained in more detail in this article `About Official Console Ports <https://godotengine.org/article/about-official-console-ports/>`__"

msgid "In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine. In other words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to distribute console export templates without requiring the user to prove that they are a licensed console developer."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/platform/consoles.rst:36
msgid "Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then sign NDAs and publishing contracts. This requires you to have a registered legal entity."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/platform/consoles.rst:39
msgid "Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. This can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly easier if an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is generally known to be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not guaranteed."

msgid "To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to sell it in. For example, game ratings are handled by `ESRB <https://www.esrb.org/>`__ in North America, and `PEGI <https://pegi.info/>`__ in Europe. Indie developers can generally get a rating for cheaper compared to more established developers."
