msgid "Localization is usually done by specific studios hired for the job. Despite the huge amount of software and file formats available for this, the most common way to do localization to this day is still with spreadsheets. The process of creating the spreadsheets and importing them is already covered in the :ref:`doc_importing_translations` tutorial. If you haven't read the Importing translations page before, we recommend you give it a read before reading this page."
