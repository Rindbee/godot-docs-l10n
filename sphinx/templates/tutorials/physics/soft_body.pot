msgid "Support for soft bodies is generally more robust in Jolt Physics compared to GodotPhysics3D. You can switch physics engines by changing **Physics > 3D > Physics Engine** in the Project Settings. Projects created in Godot 4.6 and later use Jolt Physics by default, but existing projects will have to be switched over manually."

msgid "Additionally, :ref:`physics interpolation <doc_physics_interpolation>` currently does not affect soft bodies. If you want soft body simulation to look smoother at higher framerates, you'll have to increase the **Physics > Common > Physics Ticks per Second** project setting, which comes at a performance cost."

msgid "A :ref:`SoftBody3D <class_SoftBody3D>` node is used for soft body simulations. Unlike other physics body nodes like :ref:`RigidBody3D <class_RigidBody3D>` or :ref:`StaticBody3D <class_StaticBody3D>`, it does **not** have a :ref:`CollisionShape3D <class_CollisionShape3D>` or a :ref:`MeshInstance3D <class_MeshInstance3D>` child node. Instead, the collision shape is derived from the mesh assigned to the node. This mesh is also directly used for rendering, which means you don't need to create any child nodes for a functional, visible setup."
