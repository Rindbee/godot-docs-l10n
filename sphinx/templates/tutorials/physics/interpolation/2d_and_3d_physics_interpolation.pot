msgid "In 3D, it is easy to turn interpolation on and off at the level of each ``Node``, via the :ref:`physics_interpolation_mode<class_Node_property_physics_interpolation_mode>` property in the Inspector, which can be set to ``On``, ``Off``, or ``Inherited``."

msgid "However this means that in 3D, pivots that occur in the ``SceneTree`` (due to parent child relationships) can only be interpolated **approximately** over the physics tick. In most cases this will not matter, but in some situations the interpolation can look slightly wrong."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/2d_and_3d_physics_interpolation.rst:30
msgid "In 2D, interpolated local transforms are passed down to children during rendering. This means that if a parent has ``physics_interpolation_mode`` set to ``On``, but the child is set to ``Off``, the child will still be interpolated if the parent is moving. *Only the child's local transform is uninterpolated.* Controlling the on / off behavior of 2D nodes therefore requires a little more thought and planning."

msgid "On the positive side, pivot behavior in the scene tree is perfectly preserved during interpolation in 2D, which gives super smooth behaviour."

msgid "Whenever objects are moved to a completely new position, and interpolation is not desired (so as to prevent a \"streaking\" artefact), it is the responsibility of the user to call ``reset_physics_interpolation()``."

msgid "The good news is that in 2D, this is automatically done for you when nodes first enter the tree. This reduces boiler plate, and reduces the effort required to get an existing project working."

msgid "If you move objects *after* adding to the scene tree, you will still need to call ``reset_physics_interpolation()`` as with 3D."
