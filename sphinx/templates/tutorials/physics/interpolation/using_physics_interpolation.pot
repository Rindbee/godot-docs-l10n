msgid "To convert an existing game to use interpolation, it is highly recommended that you temporarily set :ref:`Project Settings > Physics > Common > Physics Tick per Second<class_ProjectSettings_property_physics/common/physics_ticks_per_second>` to a low value such as ``10``, which will make interpolation problems more obvious."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/using_physics_interpolation.rst:34
msgid "The most fundamental requirement for physics interpolation (which you may be doing already) is that you should be moving and performing game logic on your objects within ``_physics_process`` (which runs at a physics tick) rather than ``_process`` (which runs on a rendered frame). This means your scripts should typically be doing the bulk of their processing within ``_physics_process``, including responding to input and AI."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/using_physics_interpolation.rst:41
msgid "Setting the transform of objects only within physics ticks allows the automatic interpolation to deal with transforms *between* physics ticks, and ensures the game will run the same whatever machine it is run on. As a bonus, this also reduces CPU usage if the game is rendering at high FPS, since AI logic (for example) will no longer run on every rendered frame."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/using_physics_interpolation.rst:47
msgid "If you attempt to set the transform of interpolated objects *outside* the physics tick, the calculations for the interpolated position will be incorrect, and you will get jitter. This jitter may not be visible on your machine, but it *will* occur for some players. For this reason, setting the transform of interpolated objects should be avoided outside of the physics tick. Godot will attempt to produce warnings in the editor if this case is detected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/using_physics_interpolation.rst:55
msgid "This is only a *soft rule*. There are some occasions where you might want to teleport objects outside of the physics tick (for instance when starting a level, or respawning objects). Still, in general, you should be applying transforms from the physics tick."

msgid "Consider that in Godot, nodes can be moved not just directly in your own scripts, but also by automatic methods such as tweening, animation, and navigation. All these methods should also have their timing set to operate on the physics tick rather than each frame (\"idle\"), **if** you are using them to move objects (*these methods can also be used to control properties that are not interpolated*)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/using_physics_interpolation.rst:70
msgid "Also consider that nodes can be moved not just by moving themselves, but also by moving parent nodes in the :ref:`SceneTree<class_SceneTree>`. The movement of parents should therefore also only occur during physics ticks."

msgid "Most of the time, interpolation is what you want between two physics ticks. However, there is one situation in which it may *not* be what you want. That is when you are initially placing objects, or moving them to a new location. Here, you don't want a smooth motion between where the object was (e.g. the origin) and the initial position - you want an instantaneous move."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/using_physics_interpolation.rst:104
msgid "The solution to this is to call the :ref:`Node.reset_physics_interpolation<class_Node_method_reset_physics_interpolation>` function. What this function does under the hood is set the internally stored *previous transform* of the object to be equal to the *current transform*. This ensures that when interpolating between these two equal transforms, there will be no movement."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/using_physics_interpolation.rst:110
msgid "Even if you forget to call this, it will usually not be a problem in most situations (especially at high tick rates). This is something you can easily leave to the polishing phase of your game. The worst that will happen is seeing a streaking motion for a frame or so when you move them - you will know when you need it!"

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/using_physics_interpolation.rst:147
msgid "The gameplay may not work perfectly, but it should enable you to more easily see cases where you should be calling :ref:`Node.reset_physics_interpolation<class_Node_method_reset_physics_interpolation>`, or where you should be using your own custom interpolation on e.g. a :ref:`Camera3D<class_Camera3D>`. Once you have these cases fixed, you can set the physics tick rate back to the desired setting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/physics/interpolation/using_physics_interpolation.rst:153
msgid "The other great advantage to testing at a low tick rate is you can often notice other game systems that are synchronized to the physics tick and creating glitches which you may want to work around. Typical examples include setting animation blend values, which you may decide to set in ``_process()`` and interpolate manually."
