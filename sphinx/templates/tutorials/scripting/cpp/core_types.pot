msgid "While in Godot, the ``Packed*Array`` types are aliases of ``Vector``, in godot-cpp, they're their own types, using the Godot bindings. This is because ``Packed*Array`` are exposed to Godot and limited to only Godot types, whereas ``Vector`` can hold any C++ type which Godot might not be able to understand."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/cpp/core_types.rst:77
msgid "In addition, it may be of interest that GDScript calls use the ``Variant`` call interface: Any ``Packed*Array`` arguments to your functions will be passed in a ``Variant``, and unpacked from there. This can create copies of the types, so the argument you receive may be a copy of the argument that the function was called with. In practice, this means you cannot rely on that the argument passed to you can be modified at the caller's site."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/cpp/core_types.rst:98
msgid "You should be aware that the pointer to your godot-cpp ``Object`` is different from the pointer that Godot uses internally. This is because the godot-cpp version is an extension instance, allocated separately from the original ``Object``. However, in practice, this difference is usually not noticeable."
