msgid "godot-cpp is built with the :ref:`GDExtension system <doc_gdextension>`, which allows access to Godot in almost the same way as :ref:`modules <doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>`: A lot of `engine code <https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`__ can be used in your godot-cpp project almost exactly as it is."

msgid "In particular, godot-cpp has access to all functions that :ref:`GDScript <doc_gdscript>` and :ref:`C# <doc_c_sharp>` have, and additional access to a few more for fast low-level access of data, or deeper integration with Godot."

msgid "Unlike modules, godot-cpp (and GDExtensions, in general) don't require compiling the engine's source code, making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most of the API available to GDScript and C#, allowing you to code game logic with full control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-performance code you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset library <doc_what_is_assetlib>`."

msgid "You can use the same compiled godot-cpp library in the editor and exported project. With C++ modules, you have to recompile all the export templates you plan to use if you require its functionality at runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/cpp/about_godot_cpp.rst:40
msgid "godot-cpp only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with incremental builds, this process is slower than using godot-cpp."

msgid "C++ modules provide deeper integration into the engine. GDExtension's access is not as deep as static modules."

msgid "You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."

msgid "If you notice that specific systems are not accessible via godot-cpp but are via custom modules, feel free to open an issue on the `godot-cpp repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp>`__ to discuss implementation options for exposing the missing functionality."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/cpp/about_godot_cpp.rst:68
msgid "GDExtensions targeting an earlier version of Godot should work in later minor versions, but not vice-versa. For example, a GDExtension targeting Godot 4.2 should work just fine in Godot 4.3, but one targeting Godot 4.3 won't work in Godot 4.2."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/cpp/about_godot_cpp.rst:72
msgid "For this reason, when creating GDExtensions, you may want to target the lowest version of Godot that has the features you need, *not* the most recent version of Godot. This can save you from needing to create multiple builds for different versions of Godot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/cpp/about_godot_cpp.rst:76
msgid "There is one exception to this: extensions targeting Godot 4.0 will **not** work with Godot 4.1 and later (see :ref:`updating_your_gdextension_for_godot_4_1`)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/cpp/about_godot_cpp.rst:79
msgid "GDExtensions are also only compatible with engine builds that use the same level of floating-point precision the extension was compiled for. This means that if you use an engine build with double-precision floats, the extension must also be compiled for double-precision floats and use an ``extension_api.json`` file generated by your custom engine build. See :ref:`doc_large_world_coordinates` for details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/cpp/about_godot_cpp.rst:86
msgid "Generally speaking, if you build a custom version of Godot, you should generate an ``extension_api.json`` from it for your GDExtensions, because it may have some differences from official Godot builds."
