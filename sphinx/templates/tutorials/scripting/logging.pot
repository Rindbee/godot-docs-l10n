#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/logging.rst:24
msgid "**Application > Run > Disable stdout:** Disables logging to standard output entirely. This also affects what custom loggers receive. This can be controlled at runtime by setting :ref:`Engine.print_to_stdout <class_Engine_property_print_to_stdout>`."

msgid "By default, Godot writes log files in ``user://logs/godot.log`` on desktop platforms. You can change this location by modifying the ``debug/file_logging/log_path`` project setting. Logs are rotated to keep older files available for inspection. Each session creates a new log file, with the old file renamed to contain the date at which it was rotated. Up to 5 log files are kept by default, which can be adjusted using the ``debug/file_logging/max_log_files`` project setting."

msgid "When the project crashes, crash logs are written to the same file as the log file. The crash log will only contain a usable backtrace if the binary that was run contains debugging symbols, or if it can find a debug symbols file that matches the binary. Official binaries don't provide debugging symbols, so this requires a custom build to work. See :ref:`Debugging symbols <doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem_debugging_symbols>` for guidance on compiling binaries with debugging symbols enabled."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/logging.rst:68
msgid "Log files for :ref:`print() <class_@GlobalScope_method_print>` statements are updated when standard output is *flushed* by the engine. Standard output is flushed on every print in debug builds only. In projects that are exported in release mode, standard output is only flushed when the project exits or crashes to improve performance, especially if the project is often printing text to standard output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/logging.rst:75
msgid "On the other hand, the standard error stream (used by :ref:`printerr() <class_@GlobalScope_method_printerr>`, :ref:`push_error() <class_@GlobalScope_method_push_error>`, and :ref:`push_warning() <class_@GlobalScope_method_push_warning>`) is always flushed on every print, even in projects exported in release mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/logging.rst:81
msgid "For some use cases like dedicated servers, it can be preferred to have release builds always flush stdout on print, so that logging services like journald can collect logs while the process is running. This can be done by enabling ``application/run/flush_stdout_on_print`` in the Project Settings."

msgid "Since Godot 4.5, when GDScript code encounters an error, it will log a backtrace that points to the origin of the error, while also containing the call stack leading to it. This behavior is always enabled when running in the editor, or when the project is exported in debug mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/logging.rst:93
msgid "In projects exported in release mode, backtraces are disabled by default for performance reasons. You can enable them by checking **Debug > Settings > GDScript > Always Track Call Stacks** in the Project Settings. If you use a custom logging system that reports exceptions to a remote service, it's recommended to enable this to make reported errors more actionable."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/logging.rst:163
msgid "This backtrace is also logged to the file for the current session, but it is **not** visible in the editor Output panel. Since the engine's scripting system is not running anymore when the engine is crashing, it is not possible to access it from scripting in the same session. However, you can still read the crash backtrace on the next session by loading log files and searching for the crash backtrace string (``Program crashed with signal``) using :ref:`class_FileAccess`. This allows you to access the backtrace information even after a crash, as long as the user restarts the project and file logging is enabled:"
