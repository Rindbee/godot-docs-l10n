msgid "Since Godot 4.6, there is a new **ObjectDB Profiler** tab in the Debugger bottom panel. This profiler allows you to take snapshots of the current state of the ObjectDB, which is the database that contains all the :ref:`class_object`-derived classes currently allocated in memory. This is useful for identifying memory leaks and understanding the memory usage of your project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/objectdb_profiler.rst:12
msgid "Additionally, this tool is able to visualize differences between two snapshots. This can be used to identify improvements or regressions in memory usage after making changes to your project. Reducing memory usage can lead to better performance, even in cases where memory is not a bottleneck. By reducing memory usage, you can perform fewer allocations, which can be a costly operation, especially if performed in large amounts during gameplay."
