#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:57
msgid ":ref:`print() <class_@GlobalScope_method_print>`: Prints a message. This method accepts multiple arguments which are concatenated together upon printing. This method has variants that separate arguments with tabs and spaces respectively: :ref:`printt() <class_@GlobalScope_method_printt>` and :ref:`prints() <class_@GlobalScope_method_prints>`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:61
msgid ":ref:`print_rich() <class_@GlobalScope_method_print_rich>`: Same as ``print()``, but BBCode can be used to format the text that is printed (see below)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:63
msgid ":ref:`push_error() <class_@GlobalScope_method_push_error>`: Prints an error message. When an error is printed in a running project, it's displayed in the **Debugger > Errors** tab instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:66
msgid ":ref:`push_warning() <class_@GlobalScope_method_push_warning>`: Prints a warning message. When a warning is printed in a running project, it's displayed in the **Debugger > Errors** tab instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:70

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:72
msgid ":ref:`print_verbose() <class_@GlobalScope_method_print_verbose>`: Same as ``print()``, but only prints when verbose mode is enabled in the Project Settings or the project is run with the ``--verbose`` command line argument."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:75
msgid ":ref:`printerr() <class_@GlobalScope_method_printerr>`: Same as ``print()``, but prints to the standard error stream instead of the standard output string. ``push_error()`` should be preferred in most cases."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:78
msgid ":ref:`printraw() <class_@GlobalScope_method_printraw>`: Same as ``print()``, but prints without a blank line at the end. This is the only method that does **not** print to the editor Output panel. It prints to the standard output stream *only*, which means it's still included in file logging."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:83
msgid ":ref:`print_stack() <class_@GDScript_method_print_stack>`: Print a stack trace from the current location. Only supported when running from the editor, or when the project is exported in debug mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:86
msgid ":ref:`print_tree() <class_Node_method_print_tree>`: Prints the scene tree relative to the current node. Useful for debugging node structures created at runtime."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:88
msgid ":ref:`print_tree_pretty() <class_Node_method_print_tree_pretty>`: Same as ``print_tree()``, but with Unicode characters for a more tree-like appearance. This relies on `box-drawing characters <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters>`__, so it may not render correctly with all fonts."

msgid "To get more advanced formatting capabilities, consider using :ref:`doc_gdscript_printf` along with the above printing functions."

msgid "Printing rich text"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:106
msgid "Using :ref:`print_rich() <class_@GlobalScope_method_print_rich>`, you can print rich text to the editor Output panel and standard output (visible when the user runs the project from a terminal). This works by converting the BBCode to `ANSI escape codes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code>`__ that the terminal understands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:112
msgid "In the editor output, all BBCode tags are recognized as usual. In the terminal output, only a subset of BBCode tags will work, as documented in the linked ``print_rich()`` method description above. In the terminal, the colors will look different depending on the user's theme, while colors in the editor will use the same colors as they would in the project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:120
msgid "ANSI escape code support varies across terminal emulators. The exact colors displayed in terminal output also depend on the terminal theme chosen by the user."
