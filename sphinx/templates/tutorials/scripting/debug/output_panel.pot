msgid "Using :ref:`print_rich() <class_@GlobalScope_method_print_rich>`, you can print rich text to the editor Output panel and standard output (visible when the user runs the project from a terminal). This works by converting the BBCode to `ANSI escape codes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code>`__ that the terminal understands."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/debug/output_panel.rst:80
msgid "In the editor output, all BBCode tags are recognized as usual. In the terminal output, only a subset of BBCode tags will work, as documented in the linked ``print_rich()`` method description above. In the terminal, the colors will look different depending on the user's theme, while colors in the editor will use the same colors as they would in the project."
