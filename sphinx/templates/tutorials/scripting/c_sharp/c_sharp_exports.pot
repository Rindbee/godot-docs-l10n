This difference may cause confusing behavior. To avoid this, don't use complex properties. Alternatively, if the default value can be explicitly specified, it can be overridden with the :ref:`_PropertyCanRevert() <class_Object_private_method__property_can_revert>` and :ref:`_PropertyGetRevert() <class_Object_private_method__property_get_revert>` methods."
