msgid "**GDExtension** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine interact with native `shared libraries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries>`__ at runtime. You can use it to run native code without compiling it with the engine."

msgid "Unlike modules, GDExtension doesn't require compiling the engine's source code, making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most of the API available to GDScript and C#, allowing you to code game logic with full control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-performance code you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset library <doc_what_is_assetlib>`."

msgid "GDExtension only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with incremental builds, this process is slower than using GDExtension."

msgid "Usually, GDExtensions targeting an earlier version of Godot will work in later minor versions, but not vice-versa. For example, a GDExtension targeting Godot 4.2 should work just fine in Godot 4.3, but one targeting Godot 4.3 won't work in Godot 4.2."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/what_is_gdextension.rst:122
msgid "GDExtensions are also only compatible with engine builds that use the same level of floating-point precision the extension was compiled for. This means that if you use an engine build with double-precision floats, the extension must also be compiled for double-precision floats and use an ``extension_api.json`` file generated by your custom engine build. See :ref:`doc_large_world_coordinates` for details."

msgid "Generally speaking, if you build a custom version of Godot, you should generate an ``extension_api.json`` from it for your GDExtensions, because it may have some differences from official Godot builds."
