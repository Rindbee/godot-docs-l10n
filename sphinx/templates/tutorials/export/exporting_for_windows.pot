msgid "The simplest way to distribute a game for PC is to copy the executable (``godot.exe``), compress the folder and send it to someone else. However, this is often not desired."

msgid "Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the export system. When exporting for Windows, the exporter takes all the project files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is bundled with a specially optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does not contain the editor and debugger."

If you want to manually create an ICO file for greater control over how the icon looks at different resolutions then see the :ref:`doc_changing_application_icon_for_windows` page."

msgid "Godot is capable of automatic code signing on export. To do this you must have the ``Windows SDK`` (on Windows) or `osslsigncode <https://github.com/mtrojnar/osslsigncode>`__ (on any other OS) installed. You will also need a package signing certificate, information on creating one can be found `here <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/package/create-certificate-package-signing>`__."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/export/exporting_for_windows.rst:42
msgid "On Windows, PCK embedding is also known to cause false positives in antivirus programs. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using it unless you're distributing your project via Steam as it bypasses code signing and antivirus checks."
