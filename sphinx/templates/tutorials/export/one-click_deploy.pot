msgid "One-click deploy is a feature that is available once a platform is properly configured and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since things can go wrong at many levels (platform may not be configured correctly, SDK may be incorrectly installed, device may be improperly configured, etc.), it's good to let the user know that it exists."

msgid "After adding an Android export preset marked as Runnable, Godot can detect when a USB device is connected to the computer and offer the user to automatically export, install and run the project (in debug mode) on the device. This feature is called *one-click deploy*."

msgid "One-click deploy is only available once you've added an export template marked as **Runnable** in the Export dialog. You can mark several export presets as runnable, but only one preset per platform may be marked as runnable. If you mark a second preset in a given platform as runnable, the other preset will no longer be marked as runnable."

This means the web server can't be reached by other devices on the local network or the Internet (if port forwarding is set up on the router). This is done for security reasons, as you may not want other devices to be able to access the exported project while you're testing it. Binding to ``localhost`` also prevents a firewall popup from appearing when you use one-click deploy for the web platform."

However, since other clients will be connecting to a remote device, the use of TLS is absolutely required here."

This is usually done by accessing your router's web interface then adding a NAT rule for the port in question. For IPv6 connections, you should allow the port in the router's IPv6 firewall instead.
