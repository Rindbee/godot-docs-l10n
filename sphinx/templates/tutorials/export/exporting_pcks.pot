msgid "The developer uses Godot to build a GUI tool for adding their exact API content to a project. This Godot tool must either run on a tools-enabled build of the engine or have access to one (distributed alongside or perhaps in the original game's files). The tool can then use the Godot executable to export a PCK file from the command line with :ref:`OS.execute() <class_OS_method_execute>`. The game itself shouldn't use a tool-build of the engine (for security), so it's best to keep the modding tool and game separate."

This is particularly the case with menu scenes that may preload other scenes using :ref:`preload() <class_@GDScript_method_preload>`. This means that loading a pack in the menu will not affect the other scene that was already preloaded."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/export/exporting_pcks.rst:164

To do so, create a new :ref:`autoload <doc_singletons_autoload>` script and call :ref:`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() <class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>` in the autoload script's ``_init()`` function, rather than ``_enter_tree()`` or ``_ready()``."
