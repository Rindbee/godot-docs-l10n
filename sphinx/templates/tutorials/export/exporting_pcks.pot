msgid "The developer uses Godot to build a GUI tool for adding their exact API content to a project. This Godot tool must either run on a tools-enabled build of the engine or have access to one (distributed alongside or perhaps in the original game's files). The tool can then use the Godot executable to export a PCK file from the command line with :ref:`OS.execute() <class_OS_method_execute>`. The game itself shouldn't use a tool-build of the engine (for security), so it's best to keep the modding tool and game separate."

This means that loading a pack in the menu will not affect the other scene that was already preloaded."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/export/exporting_pcks.rst:164

To do so, create a new :ref:`autoload <doc_singletons_autoload>` script and call :ref:`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() <class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>` in the autoload script's ``_init()`` function, rather than ``_enter_tree()`` or ``_ready()``."
