msgid ":ref:`Gridmaps <class_GridMap>` are a tool for creating 3D game levels, similar to the way :ref:`TileMap <doc_using_tilemaps>` works in 2D. You start with a predefined collection of 3D meshes (a :ref:`class_MeshLibrary`) that can be placed on a grid, as if you were building a level with an unlimited amount of Lego blocks."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:37

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:52

msgid "To create the NavigationMesh from a MeshLibrary scene export, place a :ref:`class_NavigationRegion3D` child node below the main MeshInstance3D for the GridMap item. Add a valid NavigationMesh resource to the NavigationRegion3D and some source geometry nodes below and bake the NavigationMesh."

msgid "It is possible to bake lightmaps onto a GridMap. Lightmap UV2 data will be reused from meshes if already present. If UV2 data is not present, then it will be automatically generated on bake with a lightmap texel size of 0.1 units. To generate UV2 data with a different lightmap texel size, you can set the global illumination mode in the Import dock to **Static Lightmaps** and specify the texel size there. This option must be changed *before* the scene is converted to a MeshLibrary, as changing it later on will not affect the existing MeshLibrary data."
msgstr ""
