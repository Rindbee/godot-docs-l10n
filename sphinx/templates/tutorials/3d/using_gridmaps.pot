msgid ":ref:`Gridmaps <class_GridMap>` are a tool for creating 3D game levels, similar to the way :ref:`TileMap <doc_using_tilemaps>` works in 2D. You start with a predefined collection of 3D meshes (a :ref:`class_MeshLibrary`) that can be placed on a grid, as if you were building a level with an unlimited amount of Lego blocks."
