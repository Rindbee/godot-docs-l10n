msgid "MSAA is available in 3 levels: 2×, 4×, 8×. Higher levels are more effective at antialiasing edges, but are significantly more demanding. In games with modern visuals, sticking to 2× or 4× MSAA is highly recommended as 8× MSAA is usually too demanding."

msgid "The downside of MSAA is that it only operates on edges. This is because MSAA increases the number of *coverage* samples, but not the number of *color* samples. However, since the number of color samples did not increase, fragment shaders are still run for each pixel only once. Therefore, MSAA does not reduce transparency aliasing for materials using the **Alpha Scissor** transparency mode (1-bit transparency). MSAA is also ineffective on specular aliasing."

Since the scale factor is defined per-axis, a scale factor of ``1.5`` will result in 2.25× SSAA while a scale factor of ``2.0`` will result in 4× SSAA.
