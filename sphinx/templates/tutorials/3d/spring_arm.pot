msgid "In Godot, this can be done by setting a :ref:`Camera3D <class_Camera3D>` as a child of a node. However, if you try this without any extra steps you'll notice that the camera clips through geometry and hides the scene."

msgid "The \"length\" of the spring arm is how far from its global position to check for collisions:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/spring_arm.rst:28
msgid "The \"shape\" of the spring arm is what it uses to check for collisions. The spring arm will \"sweep\" this shape from its origin out towards its length."

msgid "The spring arm tries to keep all of its children at the end of its length. When the shape collides with something, the children are instead placed at or near that collision point:"

msgid "If no shape is provided and the camera is not a direct child, the spring arm will fall back to using a ray cast which is inaccurate for camera collisions and not recommended."
