"So you've added a new parameter to a method, changed the return type, "
"changed the type of a parameter, or changed its default value, and now the "
"automated testing is complaining about compatibility breakages?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Breaking compatibility should be avoided, but when necessary there are "
"systems in place to handle this in a way that makes the transition as smooth "
"as possible."

"These changes are taken from `pull request #88047 <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot/pull/88047>`_, which added new pathing options to "
"``AStarGrid2D`` and other AStar classes. Among other changes, these methods "
"were modified in ``core/math/a_star_grid_2d.h``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "To:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This meant adding new compatibility method bindings to the file, which "
"should be in the ``protected`` section of the code, usually placed next to "
"``_bind_methods()``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They should start with a ``_`` to indicate that they are internal, and end "
"with ``_bind_compat_`` followed by the PR number that introduced the change "
"(``88047`` in this example). These compatibility methods need to be "
"implemented in a dedicated file, like ``core/math/a_star_grid_2d.compat."
"inc`` in this case:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unless the change in compatibility is complex, the compatibility method "
"should simply call the modified method directly, instead of duplicating that "
"method. Make sure to match the default arguments for that method (in the "
"example above this would be ``false``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This file should always be placed next to the original file, and have ``."
"compat.inc`` at the end instead of ``.cpp`` or ``.h``. Next, this should be "
"included in the ``.cpp`` file we're adding compatibility methods to, so "
"``core/math/a_star_grid_2d.cpp``:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And finally, the changes reported by the API validation step should be added "
"to the relevant validation file. Because this was done during the "
"development of 4.3, this would be ``misc/extension_api_validation/4.2-stable."
"expected`` (including changes not shown in this example):"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The instructions for how to add to that file are at the top of the file "
"itself."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you get a \"Hash changed\" error for a method, it means that the "
"compatibility binding is missing or incorrect. Such lines shouldn't be added "
"to the ``.expected`` file, but fixed by binding the proper compatibility "
"method."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"And that's it! You might run into a bit more complicated cases, like "
"rearranging arguments, changing return types, etc., but this covers the "
"basic on how to use this system."
