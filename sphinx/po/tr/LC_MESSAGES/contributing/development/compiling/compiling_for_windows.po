msgid "For compiling under Windows, the following is required:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Visual Studio Community <https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/>`_, "
"version 2019 or later. Visual Studio 2022 is recommended. **Make sure to "
"enable C++ in the list of workflows to install.** If you've already "
"installed Visual Studio without C++ support, run the installer again; it "
"should present you a **Modify** button."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`MinGW-w64 <https://mingw-w64.org/>`_ with GCC can be used as an alternative "
"to Visual Studio. Be sure to install/configure it to use the ``posix`` "
"thread model. **Important:** When using MinGW to compile the ``master`` "
"branch, you need GCC 9 or later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"`Python 3.6+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_. **Make sure to "

msgid ""
"`SCons 3.1.2+ <https://scons.org/pages/download.html>`_ build system. Using "
"the latest release is recommended, especially for proper support of recent "
"Visual Studio releases."

msgid ""
"If you have `Scoop <https://scoop.sh/>`_ installed, you can easily install "
"MinGW and other dependencies using the following command::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have `MSYS2 <https://www.msys2.org/>`_ installed, you can easily "
"install MinGW and other dependencies using the following command::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For each MSYS2 MinGW subsystem, you should then run `pip3 install scons` in "
"its shell."
msgstr ""

"To get the Godot source code for compiling, see :ref:`doc_getting_source`."

msgid "Setting up SCons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To install SCons, open the command prompt and run the following command::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are prompted with the message ``Defaulting to user installation "
"because normal site-packages is not writeable``, you may have to run that "
"command again using elevated permissions. Open a new command prompt as an "
"Administrator then run the command again to ensure that SCons is available "
"from the ``PATH``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check whether you have installed Python and SCons correctly, you can type "
"``python --version`` and ``scons --version`` into a command prompt (``cmd."
"exe``)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the commands above don't work, make sure to add Python to your ``PATH`` "
"environment variable after installing it, then check again. You can do so by "
"running the Python installer again and enabling the option to add Python to "
"the ``PATH``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If SCons cannot detect your Visual Studio installation, it might be that "
"your SCons version is too old. Update it to the latest version with ``python "
"-m pip install --upgrade scons``."
msgstr ""

msgid "Downloading Godot's source"
msgstr ""

msgid "Refer to :ref:`doc_getting_source` for detailed instructions."

"The tutorial will assume from now on that you placed the source code in ``C:"
"\\godot``."

"To prevent slowdowns caused by continuous virus scanning during compilation, "
"add the Godot source folder to the list of exceptions in your antivirus "
"software."

"For Windows Defender, hit the :kbd:`Windows` key, type \"Windows Security\" "

msgid "Selecting a compiler"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"SCons will automatically find and use an existing Visual Studio "
"installation. If you do not have Visual Studio installed, it will attempt to "
"use MinGW instead. If you already have Visual Studio installed and want to "
"use MinGW, pass ``use_mingw=yes`` to the SCons command line. Note that MSVC "
"builds cannot be performed from the MSYS2 or MinGW shells. Use either ``cmd."
"exe`` or PowerShell instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"During development, using the Visual Studio compiler is usually a better "
"idea, as it links the Godot binary much faster than MinGW. However, MinGW "
"can produce more optimized binaries using link-time optimization (see "
"below), making it a better choice for production use. This is particularly "
"the case for the GDScript VM which performs much better with MinGW compared "
"to MSVC. Therefore, it's recommended to use MinGW to produce builds that you "
"distribute to players."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All official Godot binaries are built in `custom containers <https://github."
"com/godotengine/build-containers>`__ using MinGW."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running SCons"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After opening a command prompt, change to the root directory of the engine "
"source code (using ``cd``) and type:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When compiling with multiple CPU threads, SCons may warn about pywin32 being "
"missing. You can safely ignore this warning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If all goes well, the resulting binary executable will be placed in ``C:"
"\\godot\\bin\\`` with the name ``godot.windows.editor.x86_32.exe`` or "
"``godot.windows.editor.x86_64.exe``. By default, SCons will build a binary "
"matching your CPU architecture, but this can be overridden using "
"``arch=x86_64`` or ``arch=x86_32``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This executable file contains the whole engine and runs without any "
"dependencies. Running it will bring up the Project Manager."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are compiling Godot for production use, you can make the final "
"executable smaller and faster by adding the SCons option ``production=yes``. "
"This enables additional compiler optimizations and link-time optimization."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"LTO takes some time to run and requires about 7 GB of available RAM while "
"compiling. If you're running out of memory with the above option, use "
"``production=yes lto=none`` or ``production=yes lto=thin`` for a lightweight "
"but less effective form of LTO."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to use separate editor settings for your own Godot builds and "
"official releases, you can enable :ref:`doc_data_paths_self_contained_mode` "
"by creating a file called ``._sc_`` or ``_sc_`` in the ``bin/`` folder."
