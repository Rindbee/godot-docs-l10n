"Threads are used to balance processing power across CPUs and cores. Godot "
"supports multithreading, but not in the whole engine."

"线程是用来平衡各CPU和核心的处理能力.Godot支持多线程, 但不是在整个引擎中."

"Below is a list of ways multithreading can be used in different areas of "
"Godot."

msgid ""
"However, creating scene chunks (nodes in tree arrangement) outside the "
"active tree is fine. This way, parts of a scene can be built or instantiated "
"in a thread, then added in the main thread:"
msgstr ""
"但是, 可以在激活的场景树外创建场景块(以树形式排列的节点). 这样, 可以在线程中"
"构建或实例化部分场景, 然后将其添加到主线程中:"

msgid ""
"Only use more than one thread to generate scene data if you *really* know "
"what you are doing and you are sure that a single resource is not being used "
"or set in multiple ones. Otherwise, you are safer just using the servers API "
"(which is fully thread-safe) directly and not touching scene or resources."
msgstr ""
"只有当你 \"真正\" 知道自己在做什么, 并且确信一个资源没有被多个资源使用或设置"
"时, 才可以使用多个线程来生成场景数据. 否则, 直接使用服务端的API(它是完全线程"
"安全的)而不接触场景或资源会更安全."
