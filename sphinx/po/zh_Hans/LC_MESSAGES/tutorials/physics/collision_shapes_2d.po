"You can represent the collision of most smaller objects using one or more "
"primitive shapes. However, for more complex objects, such as a large ship or "
"a whole level, you may need convex or concave shapes instead. More on that "
"below."
msgstr ""
"你可以使用一个或多个原始形状来表示大多数较小物体的碰撞. 然而, 对于更复杂的物"
"体, 如大型船舶或整个水平面, 你可能需要凸形或凹形来代替. 下面会有更多的介绍."

msgid ""
"We recommend favoring primitive shapes for dynamic objects such as "
"RigidBodies and CharacterBodies as their behavior is the most reliable. They "
"often provide better performance as well."
msgstr ""
"建议动态对象使用原始图形（如 RigidBodies 和 KinematicBodies），因为它们的行为"
"是可靠的，通常也能提供更好的性能。"

msgid "Convex collision shapes"
msgstr "凸型碰撞形状"

msgid ""
"Godot currently doesn't offer a built-in way to create 2D convex collision "
"shapes. This section is mainly here for reference purposes."
msgstr "Godot 目前没有提供创建 2D 凸形碰撞形状的内置方法。本节内容主要供参考。"

msgid ""
":ref:`Convex collision shapes <class_ConvexPolygonShape2D>` are a compromise "
"between primitive collision shapes and concave collision shapes. They can "
"represent shapes of any complexity, but with an important caveat. As their "
"name implies, an individual shape can only represent a *convex* shape. For "
"instance, a pyramid is *convex*, but a hollow box is *concave*. To define a "
"concave object with a single collision shape, you need to use a concave "
"collision shape."
msgstr ""
":ref:`凸碰撞形状 <class_ConvexPolygonShape2D>` 是图元碰撞形状和凹碰撞形状之间"
"的折衷。它们可以表示任何复杂程度的形状，但有一个重要的注意事项。顾名思义，单"
"个形状只能表示\\ *凸*\\ 形状。例如，金字塔是\\ *凸*\\ 的，而空心盒子是\\ *凹"
"*\\ 的。要用单个碰撞形状定义凹物体，你需要使用凹碰撞形状。"

msgid ""
"Depending on the object's complexity, you may get better performance by "
"using multiple convex shapes instead of a concave collision shape. Godot "
"lets you use *convex decomposition* to generate convex shapes that roughly "
"match a hollow object. Note this performance advantage no longer applies "
"after a certain amount of convex shapes. For large and complex objects such "
"as a whole level, we recommend using concave shapes instead."
msgstr ""
"根据对象的复杂程度, 可能要通过使用多个凸形而不是一个凹形碰撞形状来获得更好的"
"性能.Godot可以使用 *凸分解* 来生成与空心物体大致匹配的凸形. 请注意, 在一定数"
"量的凸形之后, 就没有了这种性能优势, 对于大而复杂的对象, 如整个关卡, 建议使用"
"凹形代替."

msgid "Concave or trimesh collision shapes"
msgstr "凹面或三面体碰撞形状"

msgid ""
"Even though concave shapes offer the most accurate *collision*, contact "
"reporting can be less precise than primitive shapes."
msgstr "即使凹形提供了最准确的 *碰撞*, 但触碰信息的精度可能不如基础形状."

msgid ""
"When not using TileMaps for level design, concave shapes are the best "
"approach for a level's collision."
msgstr "在不使用 TileMap 进行关卡设计时，凹形是关卡碰撞的最佳方法。"

msgid ""
"You can generate a concave collision shape from the editor by selecting a "
"Sprite2D and using the **Sprite2D** menu at the top of the 2D viewport. The "
"Sprite2D menu dropdown exposes an option called **Create CollisionPolygon2D "
"Sibling**. Once you click it, it displays a menu with 3 settings:"
msgstr ""
"你可以通过选择 Sprite2D，并使用 2D 视口顶部的 **Sprite2D** 菜单，从编辑器生成"
"凹碰撞形状。Sprite2D 菜单下拉菜单显示一个名为 **创建 CollisionPolygon2D 同级"
"节点** 的选项。点击它后，它会显示一个包含 3 个设置的菜单："

msgid ""
"**Simplification:** Higher values will result in a less detailed shape, "
"which improves performance at the cost of accuracy."
msgstr ""
"**简化：**\\ 较高的值将导致形状的细节较少，从而以准确性为代价来提高性能。"

msgid ""
"**Shrink (Pixels):** Higher values will shrink the generated collision "
"polygon relative to the sprite's edges."
msgstr ""
"**收缩（像素）：**\\ 较高的值将使生成的碰撞多边形相对于精灵的边缘收缩。"

msgid ""
"**Grow (Pixels):** Higher values will grow the generated collision polygon "
"relative to the sprite's edges. Note that setting Grow and Shrink to equal "
"values may yield different results than leaving both of them on 0."
msgstr ""
"**增长（像素）：**\\ 数值越大，生成的碰撞多边形就越会相对于精灵边缘增长。需要"
"注意的是，将 “增长 ”和 “收缩 ”设置为相等的值，产生的结果可能会与将它们都设置"
"为 0 的结果不同。"

msgid ""
"If you have an image with many small details, it's recommended to create a "
"simplified version and use it to generate the collision polygon. This can "
"result in better performance and game feel, since the player won't be "
"blocked by small, decorative details."
msgstr ""
"如果你的图片包含许多小细节，建议创建一个简化版本并使用它来生成碰撞多边形。这"
"样可以带来更好的性能表现和游戏体验，因为玩家不会被小小的、装饰性的细节阻碍。"

msgid ""
"To use a separate image for collision polygon generation, create another "
"Sprite2D, generate a collision polygon sibling from it then remove the "
"Sprite2D node. This way, you can exclude small details from the generated "
"collision."
msgstr ""
"要使用单独的图像生成碰撞多边形，可创建另一个 Sprite2D，从中生成一个碰撞多边形"
"的同级节点，然后移除 Sprite2D 节点。这样就可以将小细节排除在生成的碰撞之外。"

msgid "Performance caveats"
msgstr "性能方面的注意事项"

msgid ""
"You aren't limited to a single collision shape per PhysicsBody. Still, we "
"recommend keeping the number of shapes as low as possible to improve "
"performance, especially for dynamic objects like RigidBodies and "
"CharacterBodies. On top of that, avoid translating, rotating, or scaling "
"CollisionShapes to benefit from the physics engine's internal optimizations."
msgstr ""
"每个 PhysicsBody（物理体）不限于一个碰撞形状。尽管如此，我们还是建议尽量减少"
"碰撞形状的数量以提高性能。特别是对于像 RigidBody（刚体）和 CharacterBody（角"
"色体）这样的动态对象。除此之外，避免平移、旋转或缩放碰撞形状，以从物理引擎的"
"内部优化中受益。"

msgid ""
"When using a single non-transformed collision shape in a StaticBody, the "
"engine's *broad phase* algorithm can discard inactive PhysicsBodies. The "
"*narrow phase* will then only have to take into account the active bodies' "
"shapes. If a StaticBody has many collision shapes, the broad phase will "
"fail. The narrow phase, which is slower, must then perform a collision check "
"against each shape."
msgstr ""
"在 StaticBody 中使用单个未变换的碰撞形状时，引擎的\\ *宽相位*\\ 算法可以丢弃"
"不活跃的 PhysicsBody。这个\\ *窄相位*\\ 只需考虑到活跃物体的形状。如果一个 "
"StaticBody 有许多碰撞形状， 那么宽相位就会失败。较慢的窄相位必须对每个形状执"
"行碰撞检查。"

msgid ""
"If you run into performance issues, you may have to make tradeoffs in terms "
"of accuracy. Most games out there don't have a 100% accurate collision. They "
"find creative ways to hide it or otherwise make it unnoticeable during "
"normal gameplay."
msgstr ""
"如果遇到性能问题，你可能需要在准确性方面进行权衡。大多数游戏都没有100%的精确"
"碰撞。他们找到了一些具有创造性的方法来隐藏它，或者在正常的游戏中让它变得不被"
"人注意到。"
