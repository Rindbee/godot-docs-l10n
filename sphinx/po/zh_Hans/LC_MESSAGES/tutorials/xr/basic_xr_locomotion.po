msgid "Direct movement"

"世界中移动。"

msgid ""
"It is important to note that moving through the virtual world while the "
"player is standing still in the real world, can be nausea inducing "
"especially for players who are new to VR. The default settings on our "
"movement functions are fairly conservative. We advise you to stick to these "
"defaults but offer features in game to enable less comfortable settings for "
"more experienced users who are used to playing VR games."
msgstr ""
"应当注意，玩家在虚拟世界移动的同时在现实世界中处于静止状态，这可能导致晕眩，"

"守这些设置，但同时在游戏中提供为更有经验且习惯于 VR 游戏的玩家提供舒适度更低"
"的设置的功能。"

msgid ""
"Most work similarly to the basic movement features we've handled so far, "
"simply add the relevant subscene from the plugin to the controller that "
"implements it."
msgstr ""
"其中大部分与之前我们处理的基本移动功能类似，简单地将插件中相关的子场景添加到"
"负责实现的控制器中即可。"

msgid ""
"We'll look at some of these in more detail later on in this tutorial where "
"additional setup is required (such as climbing) but for others please look "
"at Godot XR Tools own help pages for details."
msgstr ""
"稍后我们会深入探究其中一些需要额外设置的功能（例如攀爬），但剩余部分请参考 "
"Godot XR 工具部分的帮助页面。"
