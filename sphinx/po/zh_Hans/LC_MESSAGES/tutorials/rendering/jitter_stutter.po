msgid "What is jitter, stutter and input lag?"
msgstr "什么是抖动、卡顿和输入延迟？"

msgid ""
"*Jitter* and *stutter* are two different alterations to visible motion of "
"objects on screen that may affect a game, even when running at full speed. "
"These effects are mostly visible in games where the world moves at a "
"constant speed in a fixed direction, like runners or platformers."
msgstr ""
"*抖动*\\ （Jitter）和\\ *卡顿*\\ （stutter）是即使游戏在全速运行时，也可能出"
"现在屏幕上物体可见运动中的两种不同变化，可能会影响游戏体验。这些问题在世界以"
"恒定速度朝着固定方向运动的游戏中影响最明显, 比如跑酷或平台类游戏."

"*Input lag* is unrelated to jitter and stutter, but is sometimes discussed "
"alongside. Input lag refers to visible on-screen delay when performing "
"actions with the mouse, keyboard, controller or touchscreen. It can be "
"related to game code, engine code or external factors (such as hardware). "
"Input lag is most noticeable in games that use the mouse to aim, such as "
"first-person games. Input lag can't be completely eliminated, but it can be "
"reduced in several ways."
msgstr ""
"*输入延迟*\\与抖动和卡顿无关，但也是经常为人讨论的话题。输入延迟指在鼠标、键"
"盘、控制器与触屏在与游戏进行互动时，在屏幕上所呈现的视觉延迟，产生的原因与游"
"戏代码、引擎代码及外部因素（如硬件因素）等方面有关。尤其是在第一人称游戏当"
"中，输入延迟尤为明显。输入延迟无法消除，但可以通过某些手段来减少输入延迟。"

"Forcing your graphics card to use the maximum performance profile can also "

msgid ""
"For fullscreen, Windows gives special priority to the game so stutter is no "
"longer visible and very rare. This is how most games are played."

"Games should use the **Exclusive Fullscreen** window mode, as opposed to "
"**Fullscreen** which is designed to prevent Windows from automatically "
"treating the window as if it was exclusive fullscreen."
msgstr ""
"游戏应该使用\\ **独占全屏**\\ 窗口模式，而不是\\ **全屏**\\ ，后者旨在防止 "
"Windows 自动将窗口视为独占全屏。"

msgid ""
"**Fullscreen** is meant to be used by GUI applications that want to use per-"
"pixel transparency without a risk of having it disabled by the OS. It "
"achieves this by leaving a 1-pixel line at the bottom of the screen. By "
"contrast, **Exclusive Fullscreen** uses the actual screen size and allows "
"Windows to reduce jitter and input lag for fullscreen games."
msgstr ""
"**全屏**\\ 旨在供想要使用每像素透明度而又不存在被操作系统禁用的风险的 GUI 应"

"Stutter may be visible on desktop Linux, but this is usually associated with "
"different video drivers and compositors. Some compositors may also trigger "
"this problem (e.g. KWin), so it is advised to try using a different one to "
"rule it out as the cause. Some window managers such as KWin and Xfwm allow "
"you to manually disable compositing, which can improve performance (at the "
"cost of tearing)."
msgstr ""
"在桌面 Linux 上可能会出现卡顿现象，但这通常与不同的视频驱动程序和合成器有关。"

"代价是撕裂）。"

msgid ""
"There is no workaround for driver or compositor stuttering, other than "
"reporting it as an issue to the driver or compositor developers. Stutter may "
"be more present when playing in windowed mode as opposed to fullscreen, even "
"with compositing disabled."
msgstr ""
"除了向驱动程序或合成器开发人员报告问题外，没有其他方法可以解决驱动程序或合成"

"The downside of increasing physics FPS is that CPU usage will increase, "
"which can lead to performance bottlenecks in games that have heavy physics "
"simulation code. This can be alleviated by increasing physics FPS only in "
"situations where low latency is critical, or by letting players adjust "
"physics FPS to match their hardware. However, different physics FPS will "
"lead to different outcomes in physics simulation, even when ``delta`` is "
"consistently used in your game logic. This can give certain players an "
"advantage over others. Therefore, allowing the player to change the physics "
"FPS themselves should be avoided for competitive multiplayer games."
msgstr ""

"Lastly, you can disable input buffering on a per-rendered frame basis by "
"calling ``Input.set_use_accumulated_input(false)`` in a script. This will "
"make it so the ``_input()`` and ``_unhandled_input()`` functions in your "
"scripts are called on every input, rather than accumulating inputs and "
"waiting for a frame to be rendered. Disabling input accumulation will "
"increase CPU usage, so it should be done with caution."

"If your monitor supports it, consider enabling variable refresh rate (G-Sync/"

"framerate cap to ``141``. This may be counterintuitive at first, but capping "
"the FPS below the maximum refresh rate range ensures that the OS never has "
"to wait for vertical blanking to finish. This leads to *similar* input lag "
"as V-Sync disabled with the same framerate cap (usually less than 1 ms "
