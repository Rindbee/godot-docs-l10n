msgstr "解析场景树节点的性能问题"

msgid ""
"Prefer using simple shapes with as few edges as possible e.g. nothing "
"rounded like a circle, sphere or torus."
msgstr ""
"喜欢使用边缘尽可能少的简单形状，例如，不要像圆形、球体或圆环那样呈圆形。"

msgid ""
"Prefer using physics collision shapes over complex visual meshes as source "
"geometry as meshes need to be copied from the GPU and are commonly much more "
"detailed than necessary."
msgstr ""
"优先使用物理碰撞形状而不是复杂的视觉网格作为来源几何体，因为网格需要从GPU复"

msgid ""
"In general avoid using very complex geometry as source geometry for baking "
"navigation meshes. E.g. never use a very detailed visual mesh, as parsing "
"its shape to data arrays and voxelizing it for the navigation mesh baking "
"will take a long time for no real quality gain on the final navigation mesh. "
"Instead, use a very simplified level of detail version of a shape. Even "
"better, use very primitive shapes like boxes and rectangles that only "
"roughly cover the same geometry but still yield a baked result good enough "
"for pathfinding."
msgstr ""
"一般来说，避免使用非常复杂的几何体作为烘焙导览网格的来源几何体。例如，永远不"
"要使用非常详细的视觉网格，因为将其形状解析为数据数组并将其体素化以进行导览网"

"形状的非常简化的细节等级版本。更好的是，使用非常原始的形状，例如盒子和矩形，"
"它们仅大致覆盖相同的几何形状，但仍然会产生足够好的路径搜寻烘焙结果。"

msgid ""
"Prefer using simple physics collision shapes over visual meshes, as the "
"source geometry for baking navigation meshes. Physics shapes are by default "
"very limited and optimized shapes that are easy and quick to parse. A visual "
"mesh on the other hand can range from simple to complex. On top, to gain "
"access to visual mesh data the parser needs to request the mesh data arrays "
"from the RenderingServer as visual mesh data is stored directly on the GPU "
"and is not cached on the CPU. This requires locking the RenderingServer "
"thread and can severely impact framerate at runtime while the rendering runs "
"multi-threaded. If the rendering runs single-threaded, the framerate impact "
"might be even worse and the mesh parsing might freeze the entire game for a "
"few seconds on complex meshes."

msgstr "避免在同一帧里更新所有 NavigationAgent 的路径。"

msgid ""
"Logical errors and wasteful operations in the custom NavigationAgent scripts "
"are very common causes of performance issues, e.g. watch out for resetting "
"the path every single frame. By default NavigationAgents are optimized to "
"only query new paths when the target position changes, the navigation map "

msgid ""
"E.g. when AI should move to the player, the target position should not be "
"set to the player position every single frame as this queries a new path "
"every frame. Instead, the distance from the current target position to the "
"player position should be compared and only when the player has moved too "
"far away a new target position should be set."
msgstr ""
"例如，当AI应移动到玩家时，目标位置不应每影格都设定为玩家位置，因为这会每影格"
"查询新路径。相反，应该比较从目前目标位置到玩家位置的距离，并且只有当玩家移动"
"得太远时才应该设定新的目标位置。"

msgid ""
"Do not check beforehand if a target position is reachable every frame. What "
"looks like an innocent check is the equivalent of an expensive path query "
"behind the scene. If the plan is to request a new path anyway should the "
"position be reachable, a path should be queried directly. By looking at the "
"last position of the returned path and if that position is in a "
"\"reachable\" distance to the checked position it answers the \"is this "
"position reachable?\" question. This avoids doing the equivalent of two full "
"path queries every frame for the same NavigationAgent."
msgstr ""
"不要预先检查每个画面是否可以到达目标位置。看似无害的检查实际上相当于幕后昂贵"
"的路径查询。如果计划无论如何都要请求新路径（如果位置可达），则应直接查询路"
"径。透过查看返回路径的最后一个位置，如果该位置距检查位置处于“可到达”距离，则"
"它会回答“该位置是否可到达？”问题。这避免了对同一个NavigationAgent每影格执行两"
"次完整路径查询的等效操作。"

msgid ""
"Divide the total number of NavigationAgents into update groups or use random "
"timers so that they do not all request new paths in the same frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Optimize overdetailed navigation meshes by reducing the amount of polygons "
"and edges."
msgstr "透过减少多边形和边的数量来优化过于详细的导览网格。"

msgid ""
"The cost of the actual path search correlates directly with the amount of "
"navigation mesh polygons and edges and not the real size of a game world. If "
"a giant game world uses very optimized navigation meshes with only few "
"polygons that cover large areas, performance should be acceptable. If the "
"game world is splintered into very small navigation meshes that each have "
"tiny polygons (like for TileMaps) pathfinding performance will be reduced."
msgstr ""
"实际路径搜寻的成本与导览网格多边形和边缘的数量直接相关，而不是与游戏世界的实"
"际大小相关。如果一个巨大的游戏世界使用非常优化的导览网格，只有少数多边形覆盖"
"大面积，那么性能应该是可以接受的。如果游戏世界被分割成非常小的导览网格，每个"
"导览网格都有微小的多边形（如TileMap），则寻路性能将会降低。"

msgid ""
"A common problem is a sudden performance drop when a target position is not "
"reachable in a path query. This performance drop is \"normal\" and the "
"result of a too large, too unoptimized navigation mesh with way to much "
"polygons and edges to search through. In normal path searches where the "
"target position can be reached quickly the pathfinding will do an early exit "
"as soon as the position is reached which can hide this lack of optimization "
"for a while. If the target position can not be reached the pathfinding has "
"to do a far longer search through the available polygons to confirm that the "
"position is absolutely not reachable."
msgstr ""
"一个常见问题是当路径查询中无法到达目标位置时效能突然下降。这种性能下降是“正常"
"的”，是导览网格太大、未优化的结果，需要搜寻大量多边形和边缘。在可以快速到达目"
"标位置的正常路径搜寻中，一旦到达该位置，寻路就会提前退出，这可以暂时隐藏这种"
"优化不足的情况。如果无法到达目标位置，则寻路必须对可用多边形进行更长的搜索，"

msgid ""
"Merge navigation meshes polygons by vertex instead of by edge connection "
"wherever possible."
msgstr "合并导览尽可能透过顶点而不是边连接来网格化多边形。"

msgid ""
"When changes are made to e.g. navigation meshes or navigation regions, the "
"NavigationServer needs to synchronize the navigation map. Depending on the "
"complexity of navigation meshes, this can take a significant amount of time "
"which may impact the framerate."
msgstr ""
"当对导览网格或导览区域进行变更时，导览服务器需要同步导览地图。根据导览网格的"
"复杂性，这可能需要大量时间，这可能会影响影格速率。"

msgid ""
"The NavigationServer merges navigation meshes either by vertex or by edge "
"connection. The merge by vertex happens when the two vertex of two different "
"edges land in the same map grid cells. This is a rather quick and low-cost "
"operation. The merge by edge connection happens in a second pass for all "
"still unmerged edges. All the free edges are checked for possible edge "
"connections by both distance and angle which is rather costly."
msgstr ""
"导览服务器透过顶点或边连接合并导览网格。当两条不同边的两个顶点落在同一地图网"
"格单元中时，就会发生以顶点合并。这是一个相当快速且低成本的操作。对于所有尚未"
"合并的边，按边连接进行合并发生在第二遍。透过距离和角度检查所有自由边缘是否有"
"可能的边缘连接，这是相当昂贵的。"

msgid ""
"So apart from the general rule to have as few polygon edges as possible, as "
"many edges as possible should be merged by vertex upfront so only a few "
"edges are left for the more costly edge connection calculation. The debug "
"Navigation PerformanceMonitor can be used to get statistics on how many "
"polygons and edges are available and how many of them are unmerged or not "
"merged by vertex. If the ratio between vertex merged and edge connections is "
"way off (vertex should be significantly higher) the navigation meshes are "
"properly created or placed very inefficient."
msgstr ""
"因此，除了具有尽可能少的多边形边的一般规则之外，还应透过顶点预先合并尽可能多"
"的边，以便只留下少量边用于成本更高的边连接计算。调试导览性能摄像头可用于取得"
"有关可用多边形和边的数量以及其中有多少未合并或未按顶点合并的统计数据。如果顶"
"点合并和边连接之间的比率相差很大（顶点应该明显更高），则导览网格会正确建立或"
"放置得非常低效。"
