msgid "Overview of debugging tools"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This guide will give you an overview of the available debugging tools in the "
"engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot comes with a powerful debugger and profilers to track down bugs, "
"inspect your game at runtime, monitor essential metrics, and measure "
"performances. It also offers options to visualize collision boxes and "
"navigation polygons in the running game."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Finally, you have options to debug the game running on a remote device and "
"to reload changes to your scenes or your code while the game is running."
msgstr ""

msgid "Debugger Panel"
msgstr "Painel do Depurador"

msgid ""
"Many of Godot's debugging tools are part of the Debugger panel, which you "
"can find information about in :ref:`doc_debugger_panel`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Debug menu options"
msgstr "Opções do menu de depuração"

msgid ""
"There are a few common debug options you can toggle on or off when running "
"your game in the editor, which can help you in debugging your game."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can find these options in the **Debug** editor menu."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are the descriptions of the options:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Deploy with Remote Debug"
msgstr "Distribuir com Depuragem Remota"

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, using one-click deploy will make the executable "
"attempt to connect to this computer's IP so the running project can be "
"debugged. This option is intended to be used for remote debugging (typically "
"with a mobile device). You don't need to enable it to use the GDScript "
"debugger locally."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Small Deploy with Network Filesystem"
msgstr "Pequena DIstribuição com Sistema de Arquivos de Rede"

msgid ""
"This option speeds up testing for games with a large footprint on remote "
"devices."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When **Small Deploy with Network Filesystem** is on, instead of exporting "
"the full game, deploying the game builds a minimal executable. The editor "
"then provides files from the project over the network."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Also, on Android, the game is deployed using the USB cable to speed up "
"deployment."
msgstr ""

msgid "Visible Collision Shapes"
msgstr "Formas de Colisão Visíveis"

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, collision shapes and raycast nodes (for 2D and "
"3D) will be visible in the running project."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Visible Paths"
msgstr "Visibility Rect (Retângulo de Visibilidade)"

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, curve resources used by path nodes will be "
"visible in the running project."
msgstr ""

msgid "Visible Navigation"
msgstr "Navegação Visível"

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, navigation meshes, and polygons will be visible "
"in the running project."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Visible Avoidance"
msgstr "Navegação Visível"

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, avoidance object shapes, radiuses, and "
"velocities will be visible in the running project."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Debug CanvasItem Redraws"
msgstr "Shaders CanvasItem"

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, redraw requests of 2D objects will become "
"visible (as a short flash) in the running project. This is useful to "
"troubleshoot low processor mode."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Synchronize Scene Changes"
msgstr "Sincronizar Mudanças de Cena"

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, any changes made to the scene in the editor "
"will be replicated in the running project. When used remotely on a device, "
"this is more efficient when the network filesystem option is enabled."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Synchronize Script Changes"
msgstr "Sincronizar Mudanças de Script"

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, any changes made to the script in the editor "
"will be reloaded in the running project. When used remotely on a device, "
"this is more efficient with the network filesystem."
msgstr ""

msgid "Keep Debug Server Open"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, the editor debug server will stay open and "
"listen for new sessions started outside of the editor itself."
msgstr ""

msgid "Customize Run Instances..."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This opens a dialog allowing you to tell Godot to run multiple instances of "
"the game at once, and to specify the command line arguments for each "
"instance. This is especially useful when building and debugging multiplayer "
"games."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "Enable Multiple Instances"
msgstr "Usando MultiMeshInstance"

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, the editor will run multiple instances of the "
"project at once when you Run Project."
msgstr ""

msgid "Below this checkbox is a selector to pick how many instances to run."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Checking the box and setting this to only 1 is the same as not checking this "
"box at all."
msgstr ""

msgid "Main Run Args"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are the arguments that will be passed to **every** instance of the "
"project when you Run Project, unless you select \"Enabled\" under \"Override "
"Main Run Args\" for a specific instance."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that these arguments are space-separated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These arguments can be accessed in your script by using :ref:"
"`get_cmdline_args<class_OS_method_get_cmdline_args>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Even if you uncheck \"Enable Multiple Instances\" these arguments will be "
"passed when you Run Project."

msgid "Launch Arguments"
msgstr "Argumentos"

msgid ""
"These are the arguments that will be passed to this specific instance of the "
"project when you Run Project. They will be **combined with** the \"Main Run "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you want to pass \"User\" arguments, that can be accessed with :ref:"
"`get_cmdline_user_args<class_OS_method_get_cmdline_user_args>` then you must "
"prefix them with two dashes **and a space** like `-- one two three`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Be aware that these dashes will apply to arguments added later in the "
"\"Launch Arguments\" on a per instance basis, which can cause some confusion "
"when combining the `Main Run Args` and `Launch Arguments`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you place `-- one two three` in the \"Main Run Args\" and `-- four five "
"six` in the \"Launch Arguments\" then the final command line arguments will "
"be `one two three -- four five six`. This is because the `--` is repeated in "
"the \"Launch Arguments\"."
msgstr ""

msgid "Script editor debug tools and options"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The script editor has its own set of debug tools for use with breakpoints "
"and two options. The breakpoint tools can also be found in the **Debugger** "
"tab of the debugger."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create a breakpoint by clicking the gutter in the left of the script "
"editor (on the left of the line numbers). When hovering this gutter, you "
"will see a transparent red dot appearing, which turns into an opaque red dot "
"after the breakpoint is placed by clicking. Click the red dot again to "
"remove the breakpoint. Breakpoints created this way persist across editor "
"restarts, even if the script wasn't saved when exiting the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also use the ``breakpoint`` keyword in GDScript to create a "
"breakpoint that is stored in the script itself. Unlike breakpoints created "
"by clicking in the gutter, this keyword-based breakpoint is persistent "
"across different machines when using version control."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **Break** button causes a break in the script like a breakpoint would. "
"**Continue** makes the game continue after pausing at a breakpoint. **Step "
"Over** goes to the next line of code, and **Step Into** goes into a function "
"if possible. Otherwise, it does the same thing as **Step Over**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The **Debug with External Editor** option lets you debug your game with an "
"external editor. This option is also accessible in **Editor Settings > "
"Debugger**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When the debugger breaks on a breakpoint, a green triangle arrow is visible "
"in the script editor's gutter. This arrow indicates the line of code the "
"debugger broke on."
msgstr ""

msgid "Debug project settings"
msgstr "Configurações de depuração do projeto"

msgid ""
"In the project settings, there is a **Debug** category with three "
"subcategories which control different things."
msgstr ""

msgid "Settings"
msgstr "Configurações"

msgid ""
"These are some general settings such as printing the current FPS to the "
"**Output** panel, the maximum amount of functions when profiling and others."
msgstr ""

msgid "GDScript"
msgstr "GDScript"

msgid ""
"These settings allow you to toggle specific GDScript warnings, such as for "
"unused variables. You can also turn off warnings completely."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shapes"
msgstr "Formas"

msgid ""
"Shapes are where you can adjust the color of shapes that only appear for "
"debugging purposes, such as collision and navigation shapes."
msgstr ""

msgid "Remote in scene dock"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When running a game in the editor two options appear at the top of the "
"**Scene** dock, **Remote** and **Local**. While using **Remote** you can "
"inspect or change the nodes' parameters in the running project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some editor settings related to debugging can be found inside the **Editor "
"Settings**, under the **Network > Debug** and **Debugger** sections."
