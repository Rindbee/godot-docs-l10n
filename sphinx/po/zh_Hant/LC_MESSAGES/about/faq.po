msgid ""
"Since Godot is an open source project, it was imperative from the start to "

msgid ""
"In the early days, the engine used the `Lua <https://www.lua.org>`__ "
"scripting language. Lua can be fast thanks to LuaJIT, but creating bindings "
"to an object-oriented system (by using fallbacks) was complex and slow and "
"took an enormous amount of code. After some experiments with `Python "
"<https://www.python.org>`__, that also proved difficult to embed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The main reasons for creating a custom scripting language for Godot were:"
msgstr "為 Godot 建立一個客製化的腳本語言的主要原因："

msgid ""
"Poor threading support in most script VMs, and Godot uses threads (Lua, "
"Python, Squirrel, JavaScript, ActionScript, etc.)."
msgstr ""
"Godot 需要使用執行緒，但大部分腳本語言 VM 對執行緒的支援都很差。 (Lua, "

"Godot works is highly inefficient (Lua, Python, JavaScript)."
msgstr ""
"大多數腳本語言 VM 都不太支援擴充類別 (Class-extending)，而要在 Godot 上用就會"
"很沒效率。(Lua, Python, JavaScript)。"

msgid ""
"Many existing languages have horrible interfaces for binding to C++, "
"resulting in a large amount of code, bugs, bottlenecks, and general "
"inefficiency (Lua, Python, Squirrel, JavaScript, etc.). We wanted to focus "
"on a great engine, not a great number of integrations."
msgstr ""
"現存語言的 C++ 綁定界面都很可怕，會導致需要大量的程式碼、Bug、瓶頸、整體上來"
"說變得很沒效率 (Lua, Python, Squirrel, JavaScript…等)。我們想要專心做出好用的"
"引擎，而不是整合一堆東西。"

msgid ""
"No native vector types (Vector3, Transform3D, etc.), resulting in highly "
"reduced performance when using custom types (Lua, Python, Squirrel, "
"JavaScript, ActionScript, etc.)."
msgstr ""
"沒有原生向量型別（例如 Vector3、Transform3D 等），當使用自訂型別（Lua、"

msgid "Which programming language is fastest?"
msgstr "哪種程式語言最快？"

msgid ""
"In most games, the *scripting language* itself is not the cause of "
"performance problems. Instead, performance is slowed by inefficient "
"algorithms (which are slow in all languages), by GPU performance, or by the "
"common C++ engine code like physics or navigation. All languages supported "

msgstr "一般來說，C# 和 GDScript 的效能在同一個數量級內，而 C++ 比兩者都快。"

msgid ""
"Comparing GDScript performance to C# is tricky, since C# can be faster in "
"some specific cases. The C# *language* itself tends to be faster than "
"GDScript, which means that C# can be faster in situations with few calls to "
"Godot engine code. However, C# can be slower than GDScript when making many "
"Godot API calls, due to the cost of *marshalling*. C#'s performance can also "
"be brought down by garbage collection which occurs at random and "
"unpredictable moments. This can result in stuttering issues in complex "
"projects, and is not exclusive to Godot."
msgstr ""
"比較 GDScript 和 C# 的效能很難，因為 C# 在某些特定情況下可能更快。C# *語言* "
"本身通常比 GDScript 快，這表示在很少呼叫 Godot 引擎程式碼的情況下，C# 可能會"
"更快。然而，由於 *marshalling* 的成本，當進行大量 Godot API 呼叫時，C# 可能會"
"比 GDScript 慢。C# 的效能也可能因為隨機且無法預測發生的垃圾回收而降低。這可能"
"會導致複雜專案中出現卡頓問題，而且這並非 Godot 獨有的問題。"

"C++, using :ref:`GDExtension <doc_what_is_gdextension>`, will almost always "
