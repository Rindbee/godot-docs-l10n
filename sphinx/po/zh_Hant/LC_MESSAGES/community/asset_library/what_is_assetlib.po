msgid "About the Asset Library"
msgstr "關於素材庫"

msgid ""
"The Godot Asset Library, otherwise known as the AssetLib, is a repository of "
"user-submitted Godot addons, scripts, tools, and other resources, "
"collectively referred to as assets. They're available to all Godot users for "
"download directly from within the engine, but it can also be accessed at "
"Godot's `official website <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_."
msgstr ""
"Godot 素材庫（AssetLib）是一個用戶提交的 Godot 擴充元件、腳本、工具以及其他資"
"源的倉庫，統稱為素材。所有 Godot 使用者都能直接在引擎內下載，也可以透過 "
"Godot 的 `官方網站 <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_ 存取。"

msgid ""
"On the surface, the Asset Library might look and function similar to asset "
"stores available for other engines, such as Unity's Asset Store, or Unreal "
"Engine's Marketplace, where you can submit both freely-available assets, as "
"well as paid, commercial ones. In addition, often times such assets are "
"distributed under non-free, proprietary licenses, limiting what you can do "
"with them."
msgstr ""
"表面上，素材庫的外觀和功能可能類似其他引擎的素材商店，例如 Unity 的 Asset "
"Store 或 Unreal Engine 的 Marketplace，你可以在這些平台上發布免費或付費的商業"
"素材。此外，這些素材經常採用非自由、專有授權，限制你對素材的使用。"

msgid ""
"The Asset Library is different - all assets are distributed free of charge, "
"and under a host of open source licenses (such as the MIT license, the GPL, "
"and the Boost Software License). This makes the AssetLib more similar to the "
"software repositories of a Linux distribution."
msgstr ""
"而素材庫則不同——所有資源皆免費提供，並採用多種開源授權（如 MIT 授權、GPL 及 "
"Boost 軟體授權）。這讓 AssetLib 更像 Linux 發行版的軟體套件庫。"

msgid ""
"This set of pages will cover how to use the AssetLib (both from inside "
"Godot, and on the website), how you can submit your own assets, and what the "
"guidelines for submission are."
msgstr ""
"本系列頁面將說明如何使用 AssetLib（無論是在 Godot 編輯器內或在網站上）、如何"
"提交自己的素材，以及提交時的相關規範。"

msgid ""
"Please note that the AssetLib is relatively young - it may have various pain "
"points, bugs, and usability issues. As with all Godot projects, the code "
"repository is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-"
"asset-library>`_, where you can submit pull requests and issues, so please "
"do not hesitate to visit it!"
msgstr ""
"請注意，AssetLib 仍屬新穎，可能會有一些問題、Bug 或易用性不足的情況。如同所"
"有 Godot 專案，程式碼庫也託管在 `GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot-asset-library>`_，你可以在那裡提交拉取請求（Pull Request）或回報問題，"
"歡迎隨時參與！"

msgid "Types of assets"
msgstr "素材的類型"

msgid ""
"Be aware that there are, broadly, two different types of assets you can post."
msgstr "請注意，你可以發布的素材大致分為兩種不同類型。"

msgid ""
"Assets labeled as \"Templates\", \"Projects\", or \"Demos\" appear under the "
"\"Asset Library\" tab in the Godot Project Manager. These assets are "
"standalone Godot projects that can run by themselves."
msgstr ""
"被標示為「範本」、「專案」或「展示」的素材，會出現在 Godot 專案管理員的「素材"
"庫」分頁下。這些素材都是可獨立運作的 Godot 專案。"

msgid ""
"Other assets show up inside of the Godot editor under the \"Asset Library\" "
"main screen tab, next to \"2D\", \"3D\", and \"Script\". These assets are "
"meant to be downloaded and placed into an existing Godot project."
msgstr ""
"其他素材則會顯示在 Godot 編輯器主畫面的「素材庫」分頁中，位於「2D」、「3D」及"
"「腳本」分頁旁。這類素材設計為可下載並放入現有的 Godot 專案內使用。"

msgid "Frequently asked questions"
msgstr "常見問題"

msgid "Can paid assets be uploaded to the asset library?"
msgstr "可以將付費素材上傳到素材庫嗎？"

msgid ""
"Not to the official one, though in the future, there might be other asset "
"libraries which allow it. That said, you are allowed to monetize and sell "
"Godot assets outside the Asset Library."
msgstr ""
"官方素材庫目前不支援付費素材，但未來或許會有其他素材庫開放此功能。不過，你可"
"以在素材庫以外的平台自由販售、營利你的 Godot 素材。"
