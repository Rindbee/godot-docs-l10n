msgid "Using sanitizers"
msgstr "使用 Sanitizer"

msgid "What are sanitizers?"
msgstr "什麼是 Sanitizer？"

msgid ""
"Sanitizers are static instrumentation tools that help find bugs that "
"traditional debuggers usually cannot catch. This is particularly useful when "
"combined with :ref:`doc_unit_testing` in continuous integration."
msgstr ""
"Sanitizer 是一種靜態檢測工具，能夠協助找出傳統除錯器通常無法發現的錯誤。這在"
"持續整合流程中，與 :ref:`doc_unit_testing` 結合時特別有用。"

msgid ""
"Sanitizers can be used on Windows, macOS and Linux by using the Clang "
"(LLVM), GCC or Visual Studio compilers. :ref:`Certain platforms "
"<doc_using_sanitizers_platform_specific_sanitizers>` may also have their own "
"sanitizers available. In situations where a single sanitizer is provided by "
"several different compilers, remember that their output and behavior will "
"differ slightly."
msgstr ""
"可於 Windows、macOS 與 Linux 上，透過 Clang（LLVM）、GCC 或 Visual Studio 編"
"譯器使用 Sanitizer。:ref:`部分平台 "
"<doc_using_sanitizers_platform_specific_sanitizers>` 也可能提供其專屬的 "
"Sanitizer。同一種 Sanitizer 若由不同編譯器提供，其輸出結果與行為可能會略有差"
"異。"

msgid "Using sanitizers on Godot"
msgstr "在 Godot 中使用 Sanitizer"

msgid ""
"Sanitizers **require** recompiling the binary. This means you cannot use "
"official Godot binaries to run sanitizers."
msgstr ""
"Sanitizer **必須** 重新編譯執行檔，這表示無法直接用官方 Godot 執行檔來運作 "
"Sanitizer。"

msgid ""
"When :ref:`compiling <toc-devel-compiling>` with any of the sanitizers "
"enabled, the resulting binary will have the ``.san`` suffix added to its "
"name to distinguish it from a binary without sanitizers."
msgstr ""
"啟用任一種 Sanitizer 進行 :ref:`編譯 <toc-devel-compiling>` 時，產生的執行檔"
"名稱會加上 ``.san`` 後綴，以和未啟用 Sanitizer 的版本做區分。"

msgid ""
"There is a performance impact as many additional runtime checks need to be "
"performed. Memory utilization will also increase. It is possible to enable "
"certain combinations of multiple sanitizers in a single build. Beware of the "
"performance impact when using multiple sanitizers at once though, as the "
"resulting binary may be excessively slow."
msgstr ""
"由於需要進行許多額外的執行時檢查，因此會影響效能，記憶體用量也會增加。部分 "
"Sanitizer 可以於單一建置中同時啟用多種組合，但需注意同時啟用多個 Sanitizer 會"
"大幅降低效能，導致產生的執行檔運作極慢。"

msgid ""
"Certain options can be passed to sanitizers without having to recompile the "
"binary using environment variables."
msgstr "某些選項可以透過環境變數傳遞給 Sanitizer，無需重新編譯執行檔。"

msgid "Address sanitizer (ASAN)"
msgstr "位址 Sanitizer（ASAN）"

msgid "Available in Clang and GCC."

msgstr ""
"`Clang ASAN 文件 <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html>`__"

msgid ""
"The address sanitizer is generally the most frequently used sanitizer. It "
"can diagnose issues such as buffer overruns and out-of-bounds access. If the "
"engine crashes with a message such as ``free(): invalid pointer``, this is "
"typically the result of a buffer overrun. (This message is printed by the C "
"runtime, not Godot.)"
msgstr ""
"Address Sanitizer 通常是最常用的工具。它可以偵測像是緩衝區溢位或越界存取等問"
"題。如果引擎當機並顯示像是 ``free(): invalid pointer`` 的訊息，通常就是緩衝區"
"溢位所導致的。（這個訊息是由 C 執行時環境印出的，不是 Godot 印出的。）"

msgid ""
"In certain situations (such as detecting uninitialized memory reads), the "
"address sanitizer doesn't suffice. "
"The :ref:`doc_using_sanitizers_memory_sanitizer` should be used instead."
msgstr ""
"在某些情況下（如偵測未初始化的記憶體讀取），位址 Sanitizer 並不適用，請改"
"用 :ref:`doc_using_sanitizers_memory_sanitizer`。"

msgid ""
"It is also possible to detect use-after-return situations by specifying the "
"``ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_stack_use_after_return=1`` environment variable before "
"*running* Godot (not when compiling it). This increases the address "
"sanitizer's runtime overhead, so only enable this feature when you actually "
"need it."
msgstr ""
"你也可以在*執行* Godot 前（非編譯時）設定 "
"``ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_stack_use_after_return=1`` 環境變數，來偵測函式返回後的"
"存取行為。此功能會增加位址 Sanitizer 的執行時負擔，建議僅在必要時啟用。"

msgid ""
"To enable the address sanitizer in a Godot build, pass the ``use_asan=yes`` "
"SCons option when compiling. Enabling ASAN generally makes the resulting "
"binary about 2× slower."
msgstr ""
"如需在 Godot 編譯時啟用位址 Sanitizer，請於編譯指令加入 ``use_asan=yes`` "
"SCons 參數。啟用 ASAN 通常會讓產生的執行檔效能降低約兩倍。"

msgid ""
"Due to a `design decision <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36971902/why-"
"cant-clang-enable-all-sanitizers/>`__, the address, memory and thread "
"sanitizers are mutually exclusive. This means you can only use one of those "
"sanitizers in a given binary."
msgstr ""
"由於 `設計決策 <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36971902/why-cant-clang-"
"enable-all-sanitizers/>`__，位址、記憶體及執行緒 Sanitizer 彼此互斥，單一執行"

"`Clang LSAN documentation <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html>`__"
msgstr "`Clang LSAN 文件 <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LeakSanitizer.html>`__"

msgid ""
"The leak sanitizer can detect memory leaks, which are situations where "
"memory that is no longer in use is never freed by the running program. This "
"can potentially lead to out-of-memory situations if the program runs for "
"long enough. Since Godot may run on :ref:`dedicated servers "
"<doc_exporting_for_dedicated_servers>` for months or even years without a "
"restart, it's important to fix memory leaks when they occur."
msgstr ""
"洩漏 Sanitizer 能偵測記憶體洩漏，也就是程式已經不再使用、但未釋放的記憶體。如"
"果程式長時間執行，最終可能造成記憶體耗盡。由於 Godot 可能會運作於 :ref:`專用"
"伺服器 <doc_exporting_for_dedicated_servers>` 上數月甚至數年不重啟，因此發現"
"洩漏時務必修正。"

msgid ""
"To enable the leak sanitizer in a Godot build, pass the ``use_lsan=yes`` "
"SCons option when compiling. Enabling LSAN only has a small performance "
"overhead, but the program will be much slower to exit as leak detection "
"occurs when the program exits."
msgstr ""
"如需於 Godot 建置啟用洩漏 Sanitizer，請於編譯指令加入 ``use_lsan=yes`` SCons "
"參數。啟用 LSAN 對效能影響很小，但程式結束時因進行洩漏檢查，結束速度會明顯變"
"慢。"

msgid ""
"The thread sanitizer is used to track down race conditions related to "
"multithreading. A race condition is when multiple threads try to modify the "
"same data at the same time. Since thread scheduling can be ordered in any "
"fashion by the operating system, this leads to incorrect behavior that only "
"occurs occasionally (and can be difficult to track as a result). To prevent "
"a race condition, you need to add a lock to ensure only one thread can "
"access the shared data at a given time."
msgstr ""
"執行緒 Sanitizer 用於追蹤多執行緒運作時的競爭條件。競爭條件是指多個執行緒同時"
"嘗試修改同一份資料。作業系統排程執行緒的順序是不可預測的，這會導致僅偶發的不"
"正確行為，因此也很難追蹤。為避免競爭條件，需加上鎖定，確保同一時間僅有一個執"
"行緒能存取共享資料。"

msgid ""
"To enable the thread sanitizer in a Godot build, pass the ``use_tsan=yes`` "
"SCons option when compiling. Enabling TSAN generally makes the resulting "
"binary 10× slower, while also multiplying memory usage by an approximately "
"8× factor."
msgstr ""
"如需於 Godot 建置啟用執行緒 Sanitizer，請於編譯時加入 ``use_tsan=yes`` SCons "
"參數。啟用 TSAN 通常會讓執行檔效能降低約 10 倍，且記憶體使用量大幅增加（約 8 "

"The undefined behavior sanitizer is used to track down situations where the "
