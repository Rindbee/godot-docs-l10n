"Godot prides itself on being very easy to build, by C++ project "
"standards. :ref:`Godot uses the SCons build system <doc_faq_why_scons>`, and "
"after the initial setup compiling the engine for your current platform "
"should be as easy as running:"
msgstr ""
"以 C++ 專案標準來說，Godot 以易於建置自豪。 :ref:`Godot 採用 SCons 建置系統 "

"But you will probably need to use at least some of the available options to "
"configure the build to match your specific needs, be it a custom engine "
"fork, a lightweight build stripped of extra modules, or an executable "
"targeting engine development."
msgstr ""
"但你很可能需要使用部分可用選項來設定建置，以符合你的特殊需求，無論是自訂引擎"
"分支、精簡移除額外模組的版本，還是針對引擎開發的可執行檔。"

"The articles below should help you navigate configuration options available, "
"as well as prerequisites required to compile Godot exactly the way you need."

"以下文章將協助你了解可用的設定選項，以及編譯 Godot 前所需的各項前置作業。"

msgid ""
"Let's start with basics, and learn how to get Godot's source code, and then "
"which options to use to compile it regardless of your target platform."
msgstr ""
"我們先從基礎開始，學習如何取得 Godot 原始碼，以及無論目標平台為何，要使用哪些"
"選項來編譯它。"

msgid "Building for target platforms"
msgstr "針對目標平台建置"

msgid ""
"Below you can find instructions for compiling the engine for your specific "
"target platform. Note that Godot supports cross-compilation, which means you "
"can compile it for a target platform that doesn't match your current "
"platform (say, target Linux while being on Windows). The guides will try "
"their best to cover all possible situations."
msgstr ""
"下方提供針對特定目標平台編譯引擎的說明。請注意，Godot 支援跨平台編譯，這表示"
"你可以在不同於目標平台的作業系統上編譯（例如在 Windows 上編譯 Linux 版本）。"
"本指南將盡力涵蓋所有情境。"

msgid "Other compilation targets and options"
msgstr "其他建置目標與選項"

msgid ""
"Some additional universal compilation options require further setup. Namely, "
"while Godot does have C#/.NET support as a part of its main codebase, it "
"does not get compiled by default to reduce the executable size for users who "
"don't need C# for their projects."
msgstr ""
"某些額外的通用建置選項需要進一步設定。舉例來說，雖然 Godot 主程式支援 "
"C#/.NET，但為了減少不需 C# 專案的使用者的可執行檔大小，預設不會編譯這部分功"
"能。"

"Articles below explain how to configure the buildsystem for cases like this, "
"and also cover some optimization techniques."
