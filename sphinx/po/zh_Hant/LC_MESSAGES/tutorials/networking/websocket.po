"The WebSocket protocol was standardized in 2011 with the original goal of "
"allowing browsers to create stable and bidirectional connections with a "
"server. Before that, browsers used to only support HTTP requests, which "
"aren't well-suited for bidirectional communication."
msgstr ""
"WebSocket 通訊協定於 2011 年標準化，原始目標是讓瀏覽器能與伺服器建立穩定的雙"
"向連線。在此之前，瀏覽器僅支援 HTTP 請求，並不適合雙向通訊。"

msgid ""
"The protocol is message-based and a very powerful tool to send push "
"notifications to browsers. It has been used to implement chats, turn-based "
"games, and more. It still uses a TCP connection, which is good for "
"reliability but not for latency, so it's not good for real-time applications "
"like VoIP and fast-paced games (see :ref:`WebRTC <doc_webrtc>` for those use "
"cases)."
msgstr ""
"此協定以訊息為單位，非常適合向瀏覽器推播通知，常用於聊天、回合制遊戲等。它仍"
"然使用 TCP 連線，雖可靠但延遲較高，不適合 VoIP 與快節奏的即時遊戲（這類情境請"
"見 :ref:`WebRTC <doc_webrtc>`）。"

msgid ""
"Due to its simplicity, its wide compatibility, and being easier to use than "
"a raw TCP connection, WebSocket started to spread outside the browsers, in "
"native applications as a mean to communicate with network servers."
msgstr ""
"由於簡單、相容性廣，且比原生 TCP 更易使用，WebSocket 也開始在瀏覽器之外普及，"
"被原生應用程式用作與網路伺服器溝通的方式。"

msgid "Godot supports WebSocket in both native and web exports."
msgstr "Godot 在原生與網頁匯出中皆支援 WebSocket。"

msgid "Using WebSocket in Godot"
msgstr "在 Godot 中使用 WebSocket"

msgid ""
"WebSocket is implemented in Godot via :ref:`WebSocketPeer "
"<class_WebSocketPeer>`. The WebSocket implementation is compatible with the "
"High-Level Multiplayer. See section on :ref:`high-level multiplayer "

"When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the ``INTERNET`` permission "
