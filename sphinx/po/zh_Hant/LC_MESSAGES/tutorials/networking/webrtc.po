"One of Godot's great features is its ability to export to the HTML5/"
"WebAssembly platform, allowing your game to run directly in the browser when "
"a user visit your webpage."
msgstr ""
"Godot 最大特色之一是可匯出 HTML5/WebAssembly 平台，讓你的遊戲直接在瀏覽器上執"
"行。"

msgid ""
"This is a great opportunity for both demos and full games, but used to come "
"with some limitations. In the area of networking, browsers used to support "
"only HTTPRequests until recently, when first WebSocket and then WebRTC were "
"proposed as standards."
msgstr ""
"這對於展示版與正式遊戲都是好機會，但過去網路功能有限。瀏覽器以前只支援 "
"HTTPRequests，直到 WebSocket、WebRTC 先後成為標準。"

msgid "WebSocket"
msgstr "WebSocket"

msgid ""
"When the WebSocket protocol was standardized in December 2011, it allowed "
"browsers to create stable and bidirectional connections to a WebSocket "
"server. The protocol is a very powerful tool to send push notifications to "
"browsers, and has been used to implement chats, turn-based games, etc."
msgstr ""
"WebSocket 協定於 2011 年 12 月標準化，讓瀏覽器能穩定雙向連線伺服器。這個協定"
"很適合推播通知，也常用於聊天、回合遊戲等。"

msgid ""
"WebSockets, though, still use a TCP connection, which is good for "
"reliability but not for latency, so not good for real-time applications like "
"VoIP and fast-paced games."
msgstr ""
"不過 WebSocket 仍然基於 TCP，傳輸可靠但延遲高，不適合 VoIP 或即時遊戲。"

msgid ""
"For this reason, since 2010, Google started working on a new technology "
"called WebRTC, which later on, in 2017, became a W3C candidate "
"recommendation. WebRTC is a much more complex set of specifications, and "
"relies on many other technologies behind the scenes (ICE, DTLS, SDP) to "
"provide fast, real-time, and secure communication between two peers."
msgstr ""
"因此，Google 從 2010 年開始開發 WebRTC，並於 2017 年成為 W3C 候選標準。"
"WebRTC 相當複雜，需結合多種技術（如 ICE、DTLS、SDP），可讓兩個節點間高速、即"
"時又安全地通訊。"

msgid ""
"The idea is to find the fastest route between the two peers and establish "
"whenever possible a direct communication (i.e. try to avoid a relaying "
"server)."
msgstr "核心理念是找出兩個節點間最快的通路，盡量直接連線，避免經過中繼伺服器。"

msgid ""
"However, this comes at a price, which is that some media information must be "
"exchanged between the two peers before the communication can start (in the "
"form of Session Description Protocol - SDP strings). This usually takes the "
"form of a so-called WebRTC Signaling Server."
msgstr ""
"但這也有交換條件：通訊前必須先交換媒體資訊（SDP 格式），這通常透過所謂的 "
"WebRTC 訊號伺服器來完成。"

msgid ""
"Peers connect to a signaling server (for example a WebSocket server) and "
"send their media information. The server then relays this information to "
"other peers, allowing them to establish the desired direct communication. "
"Once this step is done, peers can disconnect from the signaling server and "
"keep the direct Peer-to-Peer (P2P) connection open."
msgstr ""
"節點會先連到訊號伺服器（如 WebSocket 伺服器）交換媒體資訊，伺服器將這些資訊轉"
"發給其他節點，讓彼此建立直接連線。交換完成後即可斷開訊號伺服器，維持 P2P 連"
"線。"

"WebRTC is implemented in Godot via two main "
"classes :ref:`WebRTCPeerConnection <class_WebRTCPeerConnection>` "
"and :ref:`WebRTCDataChannel <class_WebRTCDataChannel>`, plus the multiplayer "
"API implementation :ref:`WebRTCMultiplayerPeer "
"<class_WebRTCMultiplayerPeer>`. See section on :ref:`high-level multiplayer "

"Godot 的 WebRTC 由兩個主要類別 :ref:`WebRTCPeerConnection "
"<class_WebRTCPeerConnection>`、:ref:`WebRTCDataChannel "
"<class_WebRTCDataChannel>` 和多人 API :ref:`WebRTCMultiplayerPeer "
"<class_WebRTCMultiplayerPeer>` 組成。更多細節請見 :ref:`高階多人連線 "

msgid ""
"These classes are available automatically in HTML5, but **require an "
"external GDExtension plugin on native (non-HTML5) platforms**. Check out the "

"When exporting to Android, make sure to enable the ``INTERNET`` permission "
"in the Android export preset before exporting the project or using one-click "
"deploy. Otherwise, network communication of any kind will be blocked by "
"Android."
msgstr ""
"匯出到 Android 時，請在匯出專案或一鍵部署前，於 Android 匯出設定啟用 "

"a signaling server."
