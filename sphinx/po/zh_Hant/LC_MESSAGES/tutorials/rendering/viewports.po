msgid "Using Viewports"
msgstr "使用視口"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Think of a :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` as a screen onto which the game "
"is projected. In order to see the game, we need to have a surface on which "
"to draw it. That surface is the Root Viewport."
msgstr ""
"可以將 :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` 想像成一個投影遊戲內容的螢幕。為了能"
"看到遊戲畫面，我們需要有一個用來繪製的表面，而這個表面就是根視口（Root "
"Viewport）。"

msgid ""
":ref:`SubViewports <class_SubViewport>` are a kind of Viewport that can be "
"added to the scene so that there are multiple surfaces to draw on. When we "
"are drawing to a SubViewport, we call it a render target. We can access the "
"contents of a render target by accessing its corresponding :ref:`texture "
"<class_Viewport_method_get_texture>`. By using a SubViewport as render "
"target, we can either render multiple scenes simultaneously or we can render "
"to a :ref:`ViewportTexture <class_ViewportTexture>` which is applied to an "
"object in the scene, for example a dynamic skybox."
msgstr ""
":ref:`子視口 <class_SubViewport>` 是一種可以加入場景的視口，讓你能有多個可用"
"來繪製的表面。當我們繪製到子視口時，這個視口就被稱為算繪目標。你可以透過取得"
"其對應的 :ref:`紋理 <class_Viewport_method_get_texture>` 來存取算繪目標的內"
"容。透過將子視口作為算繪目標，可以同時算繪多個場景，或是將畫面輸出"
"到 :ref:`ViewportTexture <class_ViewportTexture>`，並將其套用到場景內的物件"
"上，例如動態天空盒等情境。"

msgid ""
":ref:`SubViewports <class_SubViewport>` have a variety of use cases, "
"including:"
msgstr ":ref:`子視口 <class_SubViewport>` 有多種用途，例如："

msgid "Rendering 3D objects within a 2D game"
msgstr "在 2D 遊戲中算繪 3D 物件"

msgid "Rendering 2D elements in a 3D game"
msgstr "在 3D 遊戲中算繪 2D 元素"

msgid "Rendering dynamic textures"
msgstr "算繪動態紋理"

msgid "Generating procedural textures at runtime"
msgstr "於執行時動態產生程式化紋理"

msgid "Rendering multiple cameras in the same scene"
msgstr "在同一場景中算繪多個相機畫面"

msgid ""
"What all these use cases have in common is that you are given the ability to "
"draw objects to a texture as if it were another screen and can then choose "
"what to do with the resulting texture."
msgstr ""
"這些用法的共通點在於，你可以像在另一個螢幕上一樣，將物件繪製到某個紋理上，接"
"著可以自由決定如何使用這個產生出來的紋理。"

msgid ""
"Another kind of Viewports in Godot are :ref:`Windows <class_Window>`. They "
"allow their content to be projected onto a window. While the Root Viewport "
"is a Window, they are less flexible. If you want to use the texture of a "
"Viewport, you'll be working with :ref:`SubViewports <class_SubViewport>` "
"most of the time."
msgstr ""
"Godot 另一種視口是 :ref:`視窗 <class_Window>`。它們可以將內容投影到一個視窗"
"上。雖然根視口本身就是一個視窗，但它的彈性有限。如果你想要使用某個視口的紋"
"理，多數情況下會使用 :ref:`子視口 <class_SubViewport>`。"

msgid "Input"
msgstr "輸入"

msgid ""
":ref:`Viewports <class_Viewport>` are also responsible for delivering "
"properly adjusted and scaled input events to their children nodes. By "
"default :ref:`SubViewports <class_SubViewport>` don't automatically receive "
"input, unless they receive it from their direct :ref:`SubViewportContainer "
"<class_SubViewportContainer>` parent node. In this case, input can be "
"disabled with the :ref:`Disable Input "
"<class_Viewport_property_gui_disable_input>` property."
msgstr ""
":ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` 也負責將適當調整和縮放過的輸入事件傳遞給其子"
"節點。預設情況下，:ref:`子視口 <class_SubViewport>` 不會自動接收輸入，除非它"
"們從其直接的 :ref:`SubViewportContainer <class_SubViewportContainer>` 父節點"
"接收到輸入。在這種情況下，可以透過 :ref:`Disable Input "
"<class_Viewport_property_gui_disable_input>` 屬性來停用輸入。"

msgid ""
"For more information on how Godot handles input, please read the :ref:`Input "
"Event Tutorial <doc_inputevent>`."
msgstr ""
"更多關於 Godot 如何處理輸入事件的資訊，請參閱 :ref:`輸入事件教學 "
"<doc_inputevent>`。"

msgid "Listener"
msgstr "監聽器"

msgid ""
"Godot supports 3D sound (in both 2D and 3D nodes). More on this can be found "
"in the :ref:`Audio Streams Tutorial <doc_audio_streams>`. For this type of "
"sound to be audible, the :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` needs to be "
"enabled as a listener (for 2D or 3D). If you are using a :ref:`SubViewport "
"<class_SubViewport>` to display your :ref:`World3D <class_World3D>` "
"or :ref:`World2D <class_World2D>`, don't forget to enable this!"
msgstr ""
"Godot 支援 3D 音效（無論是在 2D 或 3D 節點中）。詳細內容請參閱 :ref:`音訊串流"
"教學 <doc_audio_streams>`。若要讓這類型的音效能夠被聽見，必須"
"將 :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` 啟用為監聽器（2D 或 3D 皆可）。如果你使"
"用 :ref:`子視口 <class_SubViewport>` 來顯示你的 :ref:`World3D "
"<class_World3D>` 或 :ref:`World2D <class_World2D>`，請務必記得啟用這個功能！"

msgid "Cameras (2D & 3D)"
msgstr "相機（2D 與 3D）"

msgid ""
"When using a :ref:`Camera3D <class_Camera3D>` or :ref:`Camera2D "
"<class_Camera2D>`, it will always display on the closest "
"parent :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` (going towards the root). For "
"example, in the following hierarchy:"
msgstr ""
"當你在場景中使用 :ref:`Camera3D <class_Camera3D>` 或 :ref:`Camera2D "

msgid ""
"``CameraA`` will display on the Root :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` and it "
"will draw ``MeshA``. ``CameraB`` will be captured by the :ref:`SubViewport "
"<class_SubViewport>` along with ``MeshB``. Even though ``MeshB`` is in the "
"scene hierarchy, it will still not be drawn to the Root Viewport. Similarly, "
"``MeshA`` will not be visible from the SubViewport because SubViewports only "
"capture nodes below them in the hierarchy."
msgstr ""
"``CameraA`` 會顯示在根節點的 :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` 上，並繪製 "
"``MeshA``。``CameraB`` 則會被 :ref:`子視口 <class_SubViewport>` 及其下的 "
"``MeshB`` 捕獲。即使 ``MeshB`` 在場景樹中，依然不會被繪製到根視口。反之，"
"``MeshA`` 也不會出現在子視口，因為子視口只會抓取層級結構中自己底下的節點。"

msgid ""
"There can only be one active camera per :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`, so "
"if there is more than one, make sure that the desired one has "
"the :ref:`current <class_Camera3D_property_current>` property set, or make "

msgid ""
"By default, cameras will render all objects in their world. In 3D, cameras "

msgid "Scale & stretching"
msgstr "縮放與拉伸"

msgid ""
":ref:`SubViewports <class_SubViewport>` have "
"a :ref:`size<class_SubViewport_property_size>` property, which represents "

"are overridden, but for all others, this sets their resolution."
msgstr ""

"是 :ref:`SubViewportContainer <class_SubViewportContainer>` 子節點，這個值會"
"被覆蓋；否則則會直接決定其解析度。"

msgid ""
"It is also possible to scale the 2D content and make the :ref:`SubViewport "
"<class_SubViewport>` resolution different from the one specified in size, by "
"calling:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Worlds"
msgstr "世界"

msgid ""
"For 3D, a :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` will contain a :ref:`World3D "
"<class_World3D>`. This is basically the universe that links physics and "
"rendering together. Node3D-based nodes will register using the World3D of "
"the closest Viewport. By default, newly created Viewports do not contain a "
"World3D but use the same as their parent Viewport. The Root Viewport always "
"contains a World3D, which is the one objects are rendered to by default."
msgstr ""
"在 3D 場景中，每個 :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` 會擁有一個 :ref:`World3D "
"<class_World3D>`。這個 World3D 就像一個結合物理與算繪的宇宙。所有基於 Node3D "

msgid ""
"A :ref:`World3D <class_World3D>` can be set in a :ref:`Viewport "

"useful in scenarios where, for example, you might want to show a separate "
"character in 3D imposed over the game (like in StarCraft)."
msgstr ""
"你可以透過設定 :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` 的 :ref:`World 3D "
"<class_Viewport_property_world_3d>` 屬性，指定一個專屬的 :ref:`World3D "

msgid ""
"As a helper for situations where you want to create :ref:`Viewports "
"<class_Viewport>` that display single objects and don't want to create "
"a :ref:`World3D <class_World3D>`, Viewport has the option to use "
"its :ref:`Own World3D <class_Viewport_property_own_world_3d>`. This is "

msgid ""
"For 2D, each :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` always contains its "

"through code."
msgstr ""
