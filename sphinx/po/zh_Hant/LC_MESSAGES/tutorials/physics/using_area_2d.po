msgid "Using Area2D"
msgstr "使用 Area2D"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Godot offers a number of collision objects to provide both collision "
"detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project "
"can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if you "
"understand how each of them works and what their pros and cons are. In this "
"tutorial, we'll look at the :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` node and show some "
"examples of how it can be used."
msgstr ""
"Godot 提供多種碰撞物件，能用於碰撞偵測與回應。要決定專案中該選用哪一種物件，"
"常常會讓人困惑。若你能理解每一種碰撞物件的運作方式及其優缺點，就能避免許多問"
"題並簡化開發流程。本教學將介紹 :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` 節點，並展示一些"
"實際用法範例。"

msgid ""
"This document assumes you're familiar with Godot's various physics bodies. "
"Please read :ref:`doc_physics_introduction` first."
msgstr ""
"本文假設你已熟悉 Godot 的各種物理物件。請先閱"
"讀 :ref:`doc_physics_introduction` 以瞭解基礎內容。"

msgid "What is an area?"
msgstr "什麼是區域？"

msgid ""
"An Area2D defines a region of 2D space. In this space you can detect "
"other :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` nodes overlapping, "
"entering, and exiting. Areas also allow for overriding local physics "
"properties. We'll explore each of these functions below."
msgstr ""
"Area2D 會定義出一塊 2D 空間的區域。在這區域內，你可以偵測其"
"他 :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` 節點的重疊、進入或離"
"開。區域本身也能覆寫局部的物理屬性。下面我們會分別介紹這些功能。"

msgid "Area properties"
msgstr "Area 的屬性"

msgid "Areas have many properties you can use to customize their behavior."
msgstr "區域有許多屬性可用來自訂其行為。"

msgid ""
"The ``Gravity``, ``Linear Damp``, and ``Angular Damp`` sections are used to "
"configure the area's physics override behavior. We'll look at how to use "
"those in the *Area influence* section below."
msgstr ""
"``Gravity``、``Linear Damp`` 以及 ``Angular Damp`` 區段用於設定區域的物理屬性"
"覆寫行為。這些會在下方「區域影響」章節說明。"

msgid ""
"``Monitoring`` and ``Monitorable`` are used to enable and disable the area."
msgstr "``Monitoring`` 和 ``Monitorable`` 用於啟用或停用區域偵測功能。"

msgid ""
"The ``Audio Bus`` section allows you to override audio in the area, for "
"example to apply an audio effect when the player moves through."
msgstr ""
"``Audio Bus`` （音訊匯流排）區段允許你覆寫該區域內的音訊設定，例如玩家通過時"
"可套用特殊音效。"

msgid ""
"Note that Area2D extends :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, "
"so it also provides properties inherited from that class. The ``Collision`` "
"section of ``CollisionObject2D`` is where you configure the area's collision "
"layer(s) and mask(s)."
msgstr ""
"請注意，Area2D 是 :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` 的子類"
"別，因此也繼承了該類別的屬性。你可以在 ``CollisionObject2D`` 的 "
"``Collision`` 區段中設定區域的碰撞圖層與遮罩。"

msgid "Overlap detection"
msgstr "重疊偵測"

msgid ""
"Perhaps the most common use of Area2D nodes is for contact and overlap "
"detection. When you need to know that two objects have touched, but don't "
"need physical collision, you can use an area to notify you of the contact."
msgstr ""
"Area2D 節點最常見的用途之一，就是用於接觸與重疊偵測。當你只需要知道兩個物件是"
"否碰到（但不須真的產生物理碰撞反應）時，可以用區域來通知你有無接觸。"

msgid ""
"For example, let's say we're making a coin for the player to pick up. The "
"coin is not a solid object - the player can't stand on it or push it - we "
"just want it to disappear when the player touches it."
msgstr ""
"舉例來說，假設我們要做一枚讓玩家撿取的金幣。金幣並不是實體物件——玩家不能站在"
"金幣上，也不能推動它——我們只希望玩家碰到時金幣就會消失。"

msgid "Here's the node setup for the coin:"
msgstr "以下是金幣的節點設定："

msgid ""
"To detect the overlap, we'll connect the appropriate signal on the Area2D. "
"Which signal to use depends on the player's node type. If the player is "
"another area, use ``area_entered``. However, let's assume our player is a "
"``CharacterBody2D`` (and therefore a ``CollisionObject2D`` type), so we'll "
"connect the ``body_entered`` signal."
msgstr ""
"要偵測重疊，我們需要連接 Area2D 上對應的訊號。使用哪個訊號要看玩家的節點型"
"別：如果玩家也是區域（Area2D），就用 ``area_entered``；但如果玩家是 "
"``CharacterBody2D``（所以屬於 ``CollisionObject2D`` 類型），就用 "
"``body_entered`` 訊號。"

msgid ""
"If you're not familiar with using signals, see :ref:`doc_signals` for an "
"introduction."
msgstr ""
"如果你還不熟悉訊號（Signal）的使用方式，請先參考 :ref:`doc_signals` 的介紹。"

msgid "Now our player can collect the coins!"
msgstr "現在玩家就能收集金幣了！"

msgid "Some other usage examples:"
msgstr "其他常見用法範例："

msgid ""
"Areas are great for bullets and other projectiles that hit and deal damage, "
"but don't need any other physics such as bouncing."
msgstr ""
"區域很適合拿來當作子彈或其他不需要物理反彈效果的彈體，這類物件只需偵測擊中並"
"造成傷害即可。"

msgid ""
"Use a large circular area around an enemy to define its \"detect\" radius. "
"When the player is outside the area, the enemy can't \"see\" it."
msgstr ""
"可以在敵人周圍設一個大型圓形區域來作為「偵測半徑」，玩家只要不進入該區域，敵"
"人就無法「看到」玩家。"

msgid ""
"\"Security cameras\" - In a large level with multiple cameras, attach areas "
"to each camera and activate them when the player enters."
msgstr ""
"「監視攝影機」——在大型關卡中有多台攝影機時，可在每個攝影機上綁定一個區域"
"（Area2D），當玩家進入該區域時啟動攝影機的偵測功能。"

msgid ""
"See the :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game` for an example of using Area2D in a "
"game."
msgstr "更多在遊戲中使用 Area2D 的案例，請參閱 :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`。"

msgid "Area influence"
msgstr "區域影響"

msgid ""
"The second major use for area nodes is to alter physics. By default, the "
"area won't do this, but you can enable this with the ``Space Override`` "
"property. When areas overlap, they are processed in ``Priority`` order "
"(higher priority areas are processed first). There are four options for "
"override:"
msgstr ""
"區域節點的另一個重要用途是影響物理行為。預設情況下，區域不會改變物理效果，不"
"過你可以透過 ``Space Override`` 屬性來啟用。當多個區域重疊時，會依照 "
"``Priority`` （優先級）屬性進行處理（優先級高的區域會先處理）。覆寫模式有四種"
"選項："

msgid ""
"*Combine* - The area adds its values to what has been calculated so far."
msgstr "*Combine（合併）* —— 該區域會將它的設定值加到目前已計算的值上。"

msgid ""
"*Replace* - The area replaces physics properties, and lower priority areas "
"are ignored."
msgstr ""
"*Replace（取代）* —— 該區域會完全覆蓋物理屬性，並忽略優先級較低的其他區域。"

msgid ""
"*Combine-Replace* - The area adds its gravity/damping values to whatever has "
"been calculated so far (in priority order), ignoring any lower priority "
"areas."
msgstr ""
"*Combine-Replace（合併-取代）* —— 依優先級順序，區域會將自己的重力和阻尼值加"
"到目前已計算的值上，並忽略任何優先級較低的區域。"

msgid ""
"*Replace-Combine* - The area replaces any gravity/damping calculated so far, "
"but keeps calculating the rest of the areas."
msgstr ""
"*Replace-Combine（取代-合併）* —— 該區域會取代目前所有已計算的重力／阻尼值，"
"但會繼續與剩下的區域做合併計算。"

msgid ""
"Using these properties, you can create very complex behavior with multiple "
"overlapping areas."
msgstr "透過這些設定，你可以讓多個重疊區域形成複雜的物理效果。"

msgid "The physics properties that can be overridden are:"
msgstr "可被覆寫的物理屬性包括："

msgid "*Gravity* - Gravity's strength inside the area."
msgstr "*Gravity（重力）* —— 區域內的重力強度。"

msgid "*Gravity Direction* - This vector does not need to be normalized."
msgstr "*Gravity Direction（重力方向）* —— 這個向量不需要正規化。"

msgid ""
"*Linear Damp* - How quickly objects stop moving - linear velocity lost per "
"second."
msgstr ""
"*Linear Damp（線性阻尼）* —— 物體線速度每秒損失多少，影響物體停止移動的速度。"

msgid ""
"*Angular Damp* - How quickly objects stop spinning - angular velocity lost "
"per second."
msgstr ""
"*Angular Damp（角度阻尼）* —— 物體角速度每秒損失多少，影響物體停止旋轉的速"
"度。"

msgid "Point gravity"
msgstr "重力點"

msgid ""
"The ``Gravity Point`` property allows you to create an \"attractor\". "
"Gravity in the area will be calculated towards a point, given by the ``Point "
"Center`` property. Values are relative to the Area2D, so for example using "
"``(0, 0)`` will attract objects to the center of the area."
msgstr ""
"``Gravity Point`` 屬性可以讓你建立「吸引點」。區域內的重力會朝向由 ``Point "
"Center`` 屬性指定的位置吸引。這個值是相對於 Area2D 節點本身的位置，例如設為 "
"``(0, 0)`` 時，會把物件吸向區域的中心。"

msgid "Examples"
msgstr "範例"

msgid ""
"The example project attached below has three areas demonstrating physics "
"override."
msgstr "以下附檔的範例專案中有三個區域，分別示範了不同的物理覆寫效果。"
