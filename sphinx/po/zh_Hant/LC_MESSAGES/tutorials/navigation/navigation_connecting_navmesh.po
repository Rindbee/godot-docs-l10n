"The same is true for multiple NavigationPolygon resources. As long as their "
"outline points overlap exactly the NavigationServer will merge them. "
"NavigationPolygon outlines must be from different NavigationPolygon "
"resources to connect."
msgstr ""
"多個 NavigationPolygon 資源的情況也相同。只要它們的輪廓點完全重疊，"
"NavigationServer 就會自動合併它們。要連接，NavigationPolygon 的輪廓必須來自不"
"同的 NavigationPolygon 資源。"

msgid ""
"Overlapping or intersecting outlines on the same NavigationPolygon will fail "
"the navigation mesh creation. Overlapping or intersecting outlines from "
"different NavigationPolygons will often fail to create the navigation region "
"edge connections on the NavigationServer and should be avoided."
msgstr ""
"同一個 NavigationPolygon 上重疊或相交的輪廓會導致導覽網格建立失敗。不同 "
"NavigationPolygon 之間重疊或相交的輪廓，通常也無法在 NavigationServer 上建立"
"區域邊緣連接，因此應避免這種情況。"

msgid ""
"Exactly means exactly for the vertex position merge. Small float errors that "
"happen quite regularly with imported meshes will prevent a successful vertex "
"merge."
msgstr ""
"頂點位置合併必須完全精確。匯入網格常見的小數點誤差都會導致頂點無法正確合併。"

msgid ""
"Alternatively navigation meshes are not merged but still considered as "
"**connected** by the NavigationServer when their edges are nearly parallel "
"and within distance to each other. The connection distance is defined by "
"the  ``edge_connection_margin`` for each navigation map. In many cases "
"navigation mesh edges cannot properly connect when they partly overlap. "
"Better avoid any navigation mesh overlap at all time for a consistent merge "
"behavior."
msgstr ""
"另外，若兩個導覽網格的邊緣幾乎平行且彼此接近，即使沒有合併，NavigationServer "
"也會將它們視為**已連接**。這個連接距離由每個導覽地圖的 "
"``edge_connection_margin`` 屬性決定。多數情況下，導覽網格邊緣如果部分重疊會導"
"致無法正確連接。為了確保行為一致，建議始終避免導覽網格重疊。"
