msgid ""
"When reloading the .NET assembly, Godot will attempt to serialize exported "
"members to preserve their values. A field or a property with a backing field "
"that stores a ``Callable`` may prevent the unloading of the assembly."
msgstr ""
"當重新載入 .NET 程式集時，Godot 會嘗試序列化匯出的成員以保留其值。若某個欄"
"位，或是具有支援欄位的屬性，用來儲存 ``Callable``，可能會阻止該程式集被卸載。"

msgid ""
"An expression-bodied property doesn't have a backing field and won't store "
"the ``Callable``, so Godot won't attempt to serialize it, which should "
"result in the successful reloading of the .NET assembly."
msgstr ""
"以運算式為主體的屬性沒有支援欄位，也不會儲存該 ``Callable``，因此 Godot 不會"
"嘗試序列化它，從而有助於成功重新載入 .NET 程式集。"
