msgid "Pausing games and process mode"
msgstr "遊戲暫停與處理模式"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"In most games it is desirable to, at some point, interrupt the game to do "
"something else, such as taking a break or changing options. Implementing a "
"fine-grained control for what can be paused (and what cannot) is a lot of "
"work, so a simple framework for pausing is provided in Godot."
msgstr ""
"在大多數遊戲中，通常都會希望在某些時候可以中斷遊戲，例如暫停休息或變更設定。"
"要精細地控制哪些內容可以暫停（哪些不行）非常繁瑣，因此 Godot 提供了一個簡易的"
"暫停架構。"

msgid "How pausing works"
msgstr "暫停的運作方式"

msgid ""
"To pause the game the pause state must be set. This is done by assigning "
"``true`` to the :ref:`SceneTree.paused <class_SceneTree_property_paused>` "
"property:"
msgstr ""
"要暫停遊戲，必須設定暫停狀態。只需將 :ref:`SceneTree.paused "
"<class_SceneTree_property_paused>` 屬性設為 ``true`` ："

msgid ""
"Doing this will cause two things. First, 2D and 3D physics will be stopped "
"for all nodes. Second, the behavior of certain nodes will stop or start "
"depending on their process mode."
msgstr ""
"這麼做會導致兩件事：首先，所有節點的 2D 與 3D 物理都會被暫停。其次，部分節點"
"會根據它們的處理模式，決定是否繼續執行行為。"

msgid ""
"The physics servers can be made active while the game is paused by using "
"their ``set_active`` methods."
msgstr "即使遊戲暫停，也可以用 ``set_active`` 方法讓物理伺服器維持啟用狀態。"

msgid "Process Modes"
msgstr "處理模式"

msgid ""
"Each node in Godot has a \"Process Mode\" that defines when it processes. It "
"can be found and changed under a node's :ref:`Node <class_Node>` properties "
"in the inspector."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的每個節點都有「暫停模式」來決定何時進行處理。你可以在屬性面板"
"的 :ref:`Node <class_Node>` 屬性中檢查並修改。"

msgid "You can also alter the property with code:"
msgstr "你也可以用程式碼來變更此屬性："

msgid "This is what each mode tells a node to do:"
msgstr "以下是各個模式對節點的行為說明："

msgid ""
"**Inherit**: Process depending on the state of the parent, grandparent, etc. "
"The first parent that has a non-Inherit state."
msgstr ""
"**Inherit（繼承）**：依據父節點、祖父節點等的狀態來決定是否處理。會尋找最近一"
"個非 Inherit 狀態的上層節點。"

msgid ""
"**Pausable**: Process the node (and its children in Inherit mode) only when "
"the game is not paused."
msgstr ""
"**Pausable（可暫停）**：只有在遊戲未暫停時，才會處理節點（以及處於繼承模式的"
"子節點）。"

msgid ""
"**WhenPaused**: Process the node (and its children in Inherit mode) *only* "
"when the game is paused."
msgstr ""
"**WhenPaused（僅暫停時處理）** ： *僅* 在遊戲暫停時，才會處理節點（以及繼承模"
"式下的子節點）。"

msgid ""
"**Always**: Process the node (and its children in Inherit mode) no matter "
"what. Paused or not, this node will process."
msgstr ""
"**Always（永遠處理）**：無論遊戲是否暫停，都會處理節點（及處於繼承模式的子節"
"點）。"

msgid ""
"**Disabled**: The node (and its children in Inherit mode) will not process "
"at all."
msgstr "**Disabled（停用）**：節點（及其繼承模式下的子節點）完全不會被處理。"

msgid ""
"By default, all nodes have this property in the \"Inherit\" state. If the "
"parent is set to \"Inherit\", then the grandparent will be checked and so "
"on. If a state can't be found in any of the grandparents, the pause state in "
"SceneTree is used. This means that, by default, when the game is paused "
"every node will be paused. Several things happen when a node stops "
"processing."
msgstr ""
"預設情況下，所有節點的這個屬性都是「Inherit」狀態。如果父節點也是 Inherit，就"
"會依序往上尋找，直到遇到非 Inherit 狀態的祖先節點。若都沒有，則會以 "
"SceneTree 的暫停狀態為準。換句話說，預設情況下，當遊戲暫停時，所有節點都會被"
"暫停。節點停止處理時會發生一些事情。"

msgid ""
"The ``_process``, ``_physics_process``, ``_input``, and ``_input_event`` "
"functions will not be called. However signals still work and cause their "
"connected function to run, even if that function's script is attached to a "
"node that is not currently being processed."
msgstr ""
"``_process``、``_physics_process``、``_input``、``_input_event`` 這些函式將不"
"會被呼叫。不過，訊號依然可以正常運作，連接的函式也會執行，即使該腳本掛在暫停"
"中的節點上。"

msgid ""
"Animation nodes will pause their current animation, audio nodes will pause "
"their current audio stream, and particles will pause. These resume "
"automatically when the game is no longer paused."
msgstr ""
"動畫節點會暫停目前的動畫，音訊節點會暫停目前的音訊流，粒子也會暫停。當遊戲恢"
"復時，這些內容會自動繼續。"

msgid ""
"It is important to note that even if a node is processing while the game is "
"paused physics will **NOT** work for it by default. As stated earlier this "
"is because the physics servers are turned off. The physics servers can be "
"made active while the game is paused by using their ``set_active`` methods."
msgstr ""
"需要注意的是，即使一個節點在遊戲暫停時仍有運作，預設情況下物理功能**不會**運"
"作。這是因為物理伺服器會被停用。如前所述，若要在暫停時啟用物理伺服器，可以使"
"用 ``set_active`` 方法。"

msgid "Pause menu example"
msgstr "暫停選單範例"

msgid "Start by creating a button that will be used to pause the game."
msgstr "首先，建立一個用於暫停遊戲的按鈕。"

msgid ""
"Create a menu containing a close button, set the **Process Mode** of the "
"menu's root node to **When Paused**, then hide the menu. Since the process "
"mode is set to **When Paused** on the root node, all its children and "
"grandchildren will inherit that process mode. This way, all the nodes in the "
"menu will start processing when the game is paused."
msgstr ""
"建立一個包含關閉按鈕的選單，並將選單根節點的 **處理模式** 設為 **When "
"Paused**，然後將選單隱藏。由於根節點的處理模式設為 When Paused，所有其子節點"
"與孫節點都會繼承該模式。這樣一來，在遊戲暫停時，選單內的所有節點就會開始運"
"作。"

msgid ""
"Attach a script to the menu's root node, connect the pause button created "
"earlier to a new method in the script, and inside that method pause the game "
"and show the pause menu."
msgstr ""
"將腳本掛在選單的根節點，並將前面建立的暫停按鈕連接到腳本中的新方法。在該方法"
"內讓遊戲進入暫停狀態，並顯示暫停選單。"

msgid ""
"Finally, connect the menu's close button to a new method in the script. "
"Inside that method, unpause the game and hide the pause menu."
msgstr ""
"最後，將選單的關閉按鈕連接至腳本中的另一個新方法。在該方法內恢復遊戲並隱藏暫"
"停選單。"

msgid "You should now have a working pause menu."
msgstr "現在你應該已經設計出可運作的暫停選單了。"
