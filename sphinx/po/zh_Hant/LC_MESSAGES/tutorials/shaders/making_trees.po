msgid "Making trees"
msgstr "製作樹木"

msgid ""
"This is a short tutorial on how to make trees and other types of vegetation "
"from scratch."
msgstr "這是一個簡短教學，介紹如何從零開始製作樹木及其他類型的植被。"

msgid ""
"The aim is to not focus on the modeling techniques (there are plenty of "
"tutorials about that), but how to make them look good in Godot."
msgstr ""
"本教學不著重於建模技巧（相關教學已有許多），而是說明如何讓它們在 Godot 中呈現"
"得更好看。"

msgid "Start with a tree"
msgstr "從一棵樹開始"

msgid "I took this tree from SketchFab:"
msgstr "我從 SketchFab 下載了這棵樹："

msgid "and opened it in Blender."
msgstr "並在 Blender 中開啟。"

msgid "Paint with vertex colors"
msgstr "以頂點色進行繪製"

msgid ""
"The first thing you may want to do is to use the vertex colors to paint how "
"much the tree will sway when there is wind. Just use the vertex color "
"painting tool of your favorite 3D modeling program and paint something like "
"this:"
msgstr ""
"首先，你可以利用頂點色來標示樹在有風時各部位的擺動程度。只需用你慣用的 3D 建"
"模軟體的頂點著色工具，繪製類似下圖的效果："

msgid ""
"This is a bit exaggerated, but the idea is that color indicates how much "
"sway affects every part of the tree. This scale here represents it better:"
msgstr ""
"這個效果有點誇張，但重點在於顏色表示每個部位受到擺動影響的程度。以下比例尺可"
"以更清楚地說明："

msgid "Write a custom shader for the leaves"
msgstr "為葉片編寫自訂著色器"

msgid "This is an example of a shader for leaves:"
msgstr "以下是一個葉片著色器的範例："

msgid ""
"This is a spatial shader. There is no front/back culling (so leaves can be "
"seen from both sides), and alpha prepass is used, so there are less depth "
"artifacts that result from using transparency (and leaves cast shadow). "
"Finally, for the sway effect, world coordinates are recommended, so the tree "
"can be duplicated, moved, etc. and it will still work together with other "
"trees."
msgstr ""
"這是一個空間著色器。沒有啟用正反面剔除（因此葉片可從兩側看到），並且使用了 "
"alpha 預通道，這樣利用透明度時會減少深度偽影（且葉片能投射陰影）。最後，建議"
"擺動效果使用世界座標，這樣樹木就算被複製、移動等，依然能與其他樹協同運作。"

msgid ""
"Here, the texture is read, as well as a transmission color, which is used to "
"add some back-lighting to the leaves, simulating subsurface scattering."
msgstr "這裡會讀取材質貼圖及透射色，用來給葉片添加背光效果，模擬次表面散射。"

msgid ""
"This is the code to create the sway of the leaves. It's basic (just uses a "
"sinewave multiplying by the time and axis position, but works well). Notice "
"that the strength is multiplied by the color. Every axis uses a different "
"small near 1.0 multiplication factor so axes don't appear in sync."
msgstr ""
"這段程式碼實現葉片擺動。它很基礎（僅以正弦波乘上時間與軸向位置，但效果不"
"錯）。注意強度會乘以頂點色。每個軸向都用一個接近 1.0 的不同倍率，避免軸向同步"
"擺動。"

msgid "Finally, all that's left is the fragment shader:"
msgstr "最後，剩下的就是片段著色器："

msgid "And this is pretty much it."
msgstr "大致上就這樣了。"

msgid ""
"The trunk shader is similar, except it does not write to the alpha channel "
"(thus no alpha prepass is needed) and does not require transmission to work. "
"Both shaders can be improved by adding normal mapping, AO and other maps."
msgstr ""
"樹幹的著色器也很類似，只是它不會寫入 alpha 通道（因此不需 alpha 預通道），也"
"不需要透射效果。這兩個著色器都可以加上法線貼圖、AO 及其他貼圖來進一步強化。"

msgid "Improving the shader"
msgstr "改良著色器"

msgid ""
"There are many more resources on how to do this that you can read. Now that "
"you know the basics, a recommended read is the chapter from GPU Gems3 about "
"how Crysis does this (focus mostly on the sway code, as many other "
"techniques shown there are obsolete):"
msgstr ""
"還有更多關於這方面的資源可以參考。既然你已經掌握基礎，建議閱讀 GPU Gems3 裡說"
"明 Crysis 如何實現此效果的章節（主要聚焦於擺動程式碼，因為書中其他技術多已過"
"時）："
