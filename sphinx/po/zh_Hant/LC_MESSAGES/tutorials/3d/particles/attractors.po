"Particle attractors are nodes that apply a force to all particles within "
"their reach. They pull particles closer or push them away based on the "
"direction of that force. There are three types of "
"attractors: :ref:`class_GPUParticlesAttractorBox3D`, :ref:`class_GPUParticlesAttractorSphere3D`, "
"and :ref:`class_GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D`. You can instantiate "
"them at runtime and change their properties from gameplay code; you can even "
"animate and combine them for complex attraction effects."

"The first thing you have to do if you want to use attractors is enable the "

"properties in Godot, you can also change this at runtime."
msgstr ""

"``Strength`` controls how strong the attractor force is. A positive value "

msgstr ""
"「Strength」（強度）控制吸引器施加力量的強弱。正值會將粒子拉向吸引器中心，負"

"``Attenuation`` controls the strength falloff within the attractor's "
"influence region. Every particle attractor has a boundary. Its strength is "
"weakest at the border of this boundary and strongest at its center. "
"Particles outside of the boundary are not affected by the attractor at all. "
"The attenuation curve controls how the strength weakens over that distance. "
"A straight line means that the strength is proportional to the distance: if "
"a particle is halfway between the boundary and the center, the attractor "
"strength will be half of what it is at the center. Different curve shapes "
"change how fast particles accelerate towards the attractor."
msgstr ""
"「Attenuation」（衰減）決定吸引器影響區域內力量的遞減方式。每個粒子吸引器都有"
"一個邊界，其力量在邊界處最弱、中心最強。邊界外的粒子完全不受影響。衰減曲線則"
"決定力量隨距離遞減的方式。若為直線，代表力量與距離成正比：若粒子位於中心與邊"

"The ``Directionality`` property changes the direction towards which "
"particles are pulled. At a value of ``0.0``, there is no directionality, "
"which means that particles are pulled towards the attractor's center. At "
"``1.0``, the attractor is fully directional, which means particles will be "

msgstr ""
"「Directionality」（方向性）屬性會影響粒子被吸引的方向。當數值為 ``0.0`` 時，"

"A vector field is a 3D area that contains vectors positioned on a grid. The "

"The pixel color values map to direction vectors in space. The image below "
