msgid ""
"**Note on Appearance Changes**: When enabling shadows on a light, be aware "
"that the light's appearance might change compared to when it's rendered "
"without shadows in the compatibility renderer. Due to limitations with older "
"mobile devices, shadows are implemented using a multi-pass rendering "
"approach so lights with shadows are rendered in sRGB space instead of linear "

msgstr ""
"**外觀變化注意事項**：啟用光源陰影時，請注意該光源的外觀可能會與於相容性算繪"
"器下未啟用陰影時有所不同。由於舊型行動裝置的限制，陰影採用多重算繪通道，因此"
"帶有陰影的燈光會在 sRGB 色彩空間而非線性空間下算繪。這種算繪空間的變化有時會"
