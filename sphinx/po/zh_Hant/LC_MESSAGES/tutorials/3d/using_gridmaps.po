msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
":ref:`Gridmaps <class_GridMap>` are a tool for creating 3D game levels, "
"similar to the way :ref:`TileMap <doc_using_tilemaps>` works in 2D. You "
"start with a predefined collection of 3D meshes (a :ref:`class_MeshLibrary`) "
"that can be placed on a grid, as if you were building a level with an "
"unlimited amount of Lego blocks."
msgstr ""
":ref:`Gridmaps <class_GridMap>` 是一種用於建立3D遊戲關卡的工具, 方式類似於2D"
"中使用 :ref:`TileMap <doc_using_tilemaps>` . 使用一個定義好的可以放在一個網格"
"中的 3D mesh (a :ref:`class_MeshLibrary`) (譯注,grid和mesh都譯作網格, 這裡為"
"了清晰,mesh直接使用英文,grid則譯作網格)物件集合搭建關卡, 就像您使用無限多數量"
"的樂高積木搭建世界一樣."

msgid ""
"Collisions and navigation can also be added to the meshes, just like you "
"would do with the tiles of a tilemap."
msgstr "就像使用tilemap的tile一樣, 碰撞和導覽也可以新增到網格中."

msgid "Example project"
msgstr "範例專案"

msgid ""
"To learn how GridMaps work, start by downloading the sample project: "
"`gridmap_starter.zip <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs-project-"
"starters/releases/download/latest-4.x/gridmap_starter.zip>`_."
msgstr ""
"除了這份說明文件，你可能也會想看看 `Godot Demo 專案 <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot-demo-projects>`_ 。"

msgid ""
"Unzip this project and add it to the Project Manager using the \"Import\" "
"button. You may get a popup saying that it needs to be converted to a newer "
"Godot version, click **Convert project.godot**."
msgstr ""
"解壓此專案後，使用「Import」按鈕將其加入專案管理器。若跳出提示需要轉換到較新"

msgid "Creating a MeshLibrary"
msgstr "建立 MeshLibrary"

msgid ""
"To begin, you need a :ref:`class_MeshLibrary`, which is a collection of "
"individual meshes that can be used in the gridmap. Open the "
"\"mesh_library_source.tscn\" scene to see an example of how to set up the "
"mesh library."
msgstr ""
"首先，您需要一個 :ref:`class_MeshLibrary`，它是可以在網格地圖中使用的 Mesh 的"
"集合。打開“MeshLibrary_Source.tscn”場景以查看如何設定網格庫的範例。"

msgid ""
"As you can see, this scene has a :ref:`class_Node3D` node as its root, and a "
"number of :ref:`class_MeshInstance3D` node children."
msgstr ""
"可以看到, 這個場景有一個 :ref:`class_Node3D` 節點作為它的根, 以及一"
"些 :ref:`class_MeshInstance3D` 子節點."

msgid ""
"If you don't need any physics in your scene, then you're done. However, in "
"most cases you'll want to assign collision bodies to the meshes."
msgstr ""
"如果您的場景中不需要任何物理, 那麼到這裡就完成了. 但是, 在大多數情況下, 您還"
"需要給網格指定碰撞體."

msgid "Collisions"
msgstr "碰撞"

msgid ""
"You can manually assign a :ref:`class_StaticBody3D` "
"and :ref:`class_CollisionShape3D` to each mesh. Alternatively, you can use "
"the \"Mesh\" menu to automatically create the collision body based on the "
"mesh data."
msgstr ""
"您可以手動為每個 Mesh 指定 :ref:`class_StaticBody3D` "
"和 :ref:`class_CollisionShape3D` 。或者，您可以使用“網格”功能表根據 \"Mesh\" "
"資料自動建立碰撞體。"

msgid ""
"Note that a \"Convex\" collision body will work better for simple meshes. "
"For more complex shapes, select \"Create Trimesh Static Body\". Once each "
"mesh has a physics body and collision shape assigned, your mesh library is "
"ready to be used."
msgstr ""
"請注意，“凸”（Convex）碰撞體對於簡單 Mesh 效果更好。對於更複雜的形狀，請選擇"
"“建立三角網格靜態體”。一旦每個網格都分配了物理主體和碰撞形狀，就可以使用網格"
"庫了。"

msgid "Materials"
msgstr "材質"

msgid ""
"Only the materials from within the meshes are used when generating the mesh "
"library. Materials set on the node will be ignored."

"值，既可以手動建立，也即可按下面的說明進行烘焙。"

msgid ""
"To create the NavigationMesh from a MeshLibrary scene export, place "
"a :ref:`class_NavigationRegion3D` child node below the main MeshInstance3D "

"NavigationRegion3D and some source geometry nodes below and bake the "
"NavigationMesh."
msgstr ""
"若要從 MeshLibrary 場景匯出建立 NavigationMesh，請在主要的 MeshInstance3D 下"
"方放置一個 :ref:`class_NavigationRegion3D` 子節點，新增一個有效的 "
"NavigationMesh 資源到 NavigationRegion3D，並在下方新增一些來源幾何體節點，然"
"後烘焙 NavigationMesh。"

msgid ""
"With small grid cells it is often necessary to reduce the NavigationMesh "
"properties for agent radius and region minimum size."
msgstr ""
"如果儲存格比較小，一般需要把 NavigationMesh 屬性裡的代理半徑和最小地區大小降"
"低。"

msgid ""
"Nodes below the NavigationRegion3D are ignored for the MeshLibrary scene "
"export, so additional nodes can be added as source geometry just for baking "
"the navmesh."
msgstr ""
"NavigationMeshInstance 下的節點在匯出 MeshLibrary 場景時會被忽略，所以可以專"

msgid "Lightmaps"
msgstr "光照貼圖"

msgid ""
"It is possible to bake lightmaps onto a GridMap. Lightmap UV2 data will be "
"reused from meshes if already present. If UV2 data is not present, then it "
"will be automatically generated on bake with a lightmap texel size of 0.1 "
"units. To generate UV2 data with a different lightmap texel size, you can "
"set the global illumination mode in the Import dock to **Static Lightmaps** "
"and specify the texel size there. This option must be changed *before* the "
"scene is converted to a MeshLibrary, as changing it later on will not affect "
"the existing MeshLibrary data."
msgstr ""
"可以在 GridMap 上烘焙光照貼圖。若網格已具備 UV2，將會直接重用；若沒有，烘焙時"
"會自動以 0.1 單位的光照 texel 尺寸產生。若需其他 texel 尺寸，可在匯入面板將全"
"域光照模式設為 **Static Lightmaps** 並在該處指定 texel 大小。此選項必須在場景"
"轉為 MeshLibrary *之前* 更改，之後修改將不會影響既有的 MeshLibrary 資料。"

msgid ""
"Aside from this peculiarity, the lightmap baking process is the same as for "
"any other 3D scene. See :ref:`doc_using_lightmap_gi` for more information "
"about lightmap baking."
msgstr ""

"NavigationRegion3D 可包含一個或多個額外的 :ref:`class_MeshInstance3D` 子節"
"點，這些可用於烘焙導覽網格，但不會被匯出為可見 Mesh。"

msgid ""
"Only this specific format is recognized. Other node types placed as children "
"will not be recognized and exported. GridMap is not a general-purpose system "
"for placing *nodes* on a grid, but rather a specific, optimized system, "
"designed to place *meshes* with collisions and navigation."
msgstr ""
"僅支援此特定格式。其他類型的子節點不會被識別與匯出。GridMap 並非用來在網格上"
