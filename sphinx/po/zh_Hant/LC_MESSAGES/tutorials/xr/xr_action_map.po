msgid "The XR action map"
msgstr "XR 動作對應"

msgid ""
"Godot has an action map feature as part of the XR system. At this point in "
"time this system is part of the OpenXR module. There are plans to encompass "
"WebXR into this in the near future hence we call it the XR action map system "
"in this document. It implements the built-in action map system of OpenXR "
"mostly exactly as it is offered."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的 XR 系統中包含動作對應功能。目前此系統屬於 OpenXR 模組。未來預計也會"
"納入 WebXR，因此本文件統稱為 XR 動作對應系統。它幾乎完全依照 OpenXR 內建的動"
"作對應系統實作。"

msgid ""
"The XR action map system exposes input, positional data and output for XR "
"controllers to your game/application. It does this by exposing named actions "
"that can be tailored to your game/application and binding these to the "
"actual inputs and outputs on your XR devices."
msgstr ""
"XR 動作對應系統會將 XR 控制器的輸入、空間定位資料與輸出公開給您的遊戲/應用程"
"式。其原理是公開可自訂的命名動作，並將這些動作綁定到 XR 裝置上的實際輸入與輸"
"出。"

msgid ""
"As the XR action map is currently part of the OpenXR module, OpenXR needs to "
"be enabled in your project settings to expose it:"
msgstr ""
"由於 XR 動作對應目前屬於 OpenXR 模組，因此必須於專案設定中啟用 OpenXR 才能使"
"用本功能："

msgid ""
"You will then find the XR Action Map interface in the bottom of the screen:"
msgstr "接著您會在畫面下方看到 XR 動作對應介面："

msgid ""
"Godot's built-in input system has many things in common with the XR action "
"map system. In fact our original idea was to add functionality to the "
"existing input system and expose the data to the OpenXR action map system. "
"We may revisit that idea at some point but as it turns out there were just "
"too many problems to overcome. To name a few:"
msgstr ""
"Godot 的內建輸入系統與 XR 動作對應系統有許多共通之處。最初我們原本打算直接在"
"既有輸入系統上增擴功能，並將資料公開給 OpenXR 動作對應系統。雖然這想法不排除"
"未來重啟，但實際上障礙不少，例如："

msgid ""
"Godot's input system mainly centers around button inputs, XR adds triggers, "
"axis, poses and haptics (output) into the mix. This would greatly complicate "
"the input system with features that won't work for normal controllers or "
"contrast with the current approach. It was felt this would lead to confusion "
"for the majority of Godot users."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的輸入系統主要以按鍵輸入為核心，而 XR 則增加了扳機、軸向、姿勢與觸覺"
"（輸出）等概念。這會讓輸入系統變得過於複雜，且許多功能不適用於一般手把或會與"
"現有設計衝突，進而造成多數 Godot 使用者困惑。"

msgid ""
"Godot's input system works with raw input data that is parsed and triggers "
"emitting actions. This input data is made available to the end user. OpenXR "
"completely hides raw data and does all the parsing for us, we only get "
"access to already parsed action data. This inconsistency is likely to lead "
"to bugs when an unsuspecting user tries to use an XR device as a normal "
"input device."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的輸入系統是以原始資料為基礎，經解析後觸發動作，並將此類資料直接提供給"
"用戶端。而 OpenXR 則完全隱藏原始資料，所有解析都內部完成，僅提供已處理好的動"
"作資料。這樣的不一致，若開發者誤把 XR 裝置當作一般輸入裝置使用，容易發生錯"
"誤。"

msgid ""
"Godot's input system allows changes to what inputs are bound to actions in "
"runtime, OpenXR does not."
msgstr "Godot 的輸入系統允許在執行時動態更換輸入對應的動作，但 OpenXR 不支援。"

msgid ""
"Godot's input system is based on device ids which are meaningless in OpenXR."
msgstr "Godot 的輸入系統以裝置 ID 區分來源，但在 OpenXR 中並無此意義。"

msgid ""
"This does mean that a game/application that mixes traditional inputs with XR "
"controllers will have a separation. For most applications either one or the "
"other is used and this is not seen as a problem. In the end, it's a "
"limitation of the system."
msgstr ""
"這也意味著同時支援傳統輸入與 XR 控制器的遊戲/應用程式，這兩者會被系統分開處"
"理。對大多數應用來說只需選用其中一種，並不成問題。歸根究柢，這是系統的設計限"
"制。"

msgid "The default action map"
msgstr "預設動作對應"

msgid ""
"Godot will automatically create a default action map if no action map file "
"is found."
msgstr "若專案未偵測到動作對應檔，Godot 會自動建立一份預設動作對應。"

msgid ""
"This default map was designed to help developers port their XR games/"
"applications from Godot 3 to Godot 4. As a result this map essentially binds "
"all known inputs on all controllers supported by default, to actions one on "
"one. This is not a good example of setting up an action map. It does allow a "
"new developer to have a starting point when they want to become familiar "
"with Godot XR. It prevents having to design a proper action map for their "
"game/application first."
msgstr ""
"這份預設對應是為協助開發者將 XR 遊戲/應用從 Godot 3 移植到 Godot 4 而設計。它"
"基本上將所有已知的預設控制器輸入一對一綁定到動作上。這並非良好的對應設計範"
"例，但對初學者來說可直接上手 Godot XR，無須先行設計專屬動作對應。"

msgid ""
"For this walkthrough we're going to start with a blank action map. You can "
"delete the \"Godot action set\" entry at the top by pressing the trash can "
"icon. This will clear out all actions. You might also want to remove the "
"controllers that you do not wish to setup, more on this later."
msgstr ""
"本教學將從一張空白的動作對應開始。可點選頂端的垃圾桶圖示刪除「Godot 操作集」"

msgid "Action sets"
msgstr "動作集"

msgid ""
"Before we dive in, you will see the term XR runtime used throughout this "
"document. With XR runtime we mean the software that is controlling and "
"interacting with the AR or VR headset. The XR runtime then exposes this to "
"us through an API such as OpenXR. So:"
msgstr ""
"在開始之前，你會多次看到「XR 執行環境」這個詞。這裡指的是負責控制與管理 AR/"

msgid ""
"The action map allows us to organize our actions in sets. Each set can be "
"enabled or disabled on its own."
msgstr "動作對應可以將動作分組為多個動作集，每組皆可獨立啟用或停用。"

msgid ""
"The concept here is that you could have different sets that provide bindings "
"in different scenarios. You could have:"
msgstr "可根據不同情境設計多組動作集，例如："

msgid "a ``Character control`` set for when you're walking around,"
msgstr "「角色控制」動作集，對應玩家自由移動時，"

msgid "a ``Vehicle control`` set for when you're operating a vehicle,"
msgstr "「載具控制」動作集，對應駕駛載具時，"

msgid ""
"Only the action set applicable to the current state of your game/application "

msgstr "每次僅啟用適用於遊戲/應用目前狀態的動作集。"

msgid ""
"This is especially important if you wish to bind the same input on a "

msgid ""
"OpenXR will only bind an input or output to a single action. If the same "

msgstr ""
"OpenXR 一次僅允許將某個輸入或輸出綁定到單一動作。如果多個動作集同時啟用且都有"
"綁定同一輸入/輸出，會以優先權最高的動作集為主。故如上述範例，務必確保僅啟用一"

msgid ""
"For your first XR game/application we highly recommend starting with just a "
"single action set and to not over-engineer things."
msgstr "建議您的第一個 XR 專案僅設計一組動作集，避免過度設計。"
