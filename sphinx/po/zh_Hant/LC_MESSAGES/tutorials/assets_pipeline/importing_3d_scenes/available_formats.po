msgid ""
"There are two reasons to use glTF with the textures separate. One is to have "
"the scene description in a text based format and the binary data in a "
"separate binary file. This can be useful for version control if you want to "
"review changes in a text-based format. The second is you need the texture "
"files separate from the material file. If you don't need either of those, "
"glTF binary files are fine."
msgstr ""
"分開匯出 glTF 紋理的理由主要有兩個：一、方便用純文字檔追蹤場景內容改動（適合"

msgid ""
"The glTF import process first loads the glTF file's data into an in-memory "

"The export process is the reverse of this, a Godot scene is converted to a "
"GLTFState class, then the glTF file is generated from that."
msgstr ""
"glTF 匯入流程會先將檔案資料載入 GLTFState 類別，再以此資料建立 Godot 場景。若"

"By default, Blender has backface culling disabled on materials and will "
