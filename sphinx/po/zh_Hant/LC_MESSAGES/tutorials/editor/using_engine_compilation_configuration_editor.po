"Godot comes with a large set of built-in features. While this is convenient, "
"this also means its binary size is larger than it could be, especially for "
"projects that only use a small portion of its feature set."
msgstr ""
"Godot 內建了大量功能。雖然相當便利，但也意味著二進位檔體積可能較大，特別是對"
"只使用少部分功能的專案而言。"

msgid ""
"To help reduce binary size, it is possible to compile custom export "
"templates with certain features disabled. This is described in detail "
"in :ref:`doc_optimizing_for_size`. However, determining which features need "
"to be disabled can be a tedious task. The engine compilation configuration "
"editor aims to address this by providing an interface to view and manage "
"these features easily, while also being able to detect the features "
"currently being used in the project."
msgstr ""
"為了縮小二進位體積，可以編譯自訂的匯出範本並停用特定功能；詳情"
"見 :ref:`doc_optimizing_for_size`。然而決定要停用哪些功能可能相當繁瑣。引擎編"

msgstr "瀏覽清單並手動取消勾選不需要的功能。"

msgid ""
"Use the :button:`Detect from Project` button to automatically detect "
"features currently used in the project and disable unused features. Note "
"that this will override the existing list of features, so if you have "
"manually unchecked some items, their state will be reset based on whether "
"the project actually uses the feature."
msgstr ""
"使用 :button:`Detect from Project` 按鈕可自動偵測專案目前使用的功能，並停用未"
"使用的功能。請注意，這會覆蓋現有的功能清單，因此如果你曾手動取消勾選某些項"

"Once you click :button:`Detect from Project`, the project detection step "

msgid ""
"Unchecking features in this dialog will not reduce binary size directly on "
"export. Since it is only possible to actually remove features from the "
"binary at compile-time, you still need to compile custom export templates "
"with the build profile specified to actually benefit from the engine "
"compilation configuration editor."
msgstr ""
"在此對話框中取消勾選功能不會在匯出時直接減少二進位大小。實際移除二進位中的功"

"You can now save the build profile by clicking **Save As** at the top. The "
"build profile can be saved in any location, but it's a good idea to save it "
"somewhere in your project folder and add it to version control to be able to "
"go back to it later when needed. This also allows using version control to "
"track changes to the build profile."
msgstr ""
"你可以點擊頂端的 **Save As** 來儲存建置設定檔。建置設定檔可以儲存到任意位置，"
"但建議將其放在專案資料夾中並加入版本控制，以便日後需要時能回溯。此外也能透過"
"版本控制來追蹤建置設定檔的變更。"

msgid ""
"The build profile is a JSON file (and ``.gdbuild`` extension) that looks "
