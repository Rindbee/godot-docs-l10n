msgstr "什麼是 ``@tool``？"

msgid ""
"``@tool`` is a powerful line of code that, when added at the top of your "
"script, makes it execute in the editor. You can also decide which parts of "
"the script execute in the editor, which in game, and which in both."
msgstr ""
"``@tool`` 是一個強大的註記，只要加在腳本最上方，腳本就能在編輯器中執行。你也"
"可以決定腳本的哪些部分在編輯器中執行、哪些部分在遊戲中執行，或哪些會在兩者皆"
"執行。"

"You can use it for doing many things, but it is mostly useful in level "

"If you have a cannon that shoots cannonballs affected by physics (gravity), "
"you can draw the cannonball's trajectory in the editor, making level design "
"a lot easier."
msgstr ""
"如果你有一門發射受物理（重力）影響的砲彈的大砲，你可以直接在編輯器裡繪製砲彈"
"軌跡，讓關卡設計更直觀簡單。"

msgid ""
"If you have jumppads with varying jump heights, you can draw the maximum "
"jump height a player would reach if it jumped on one, also making level "
"design easier."
msgstr ""
"如果你有多種跳躍高度的跳板，可以在編輯器裡標示玩家能跳到的最大高度，讓關卡設"

msgid ""
"If your player doesn't use a sprite, but draws itself using code, you can "
"make that drawing code execute in the editor to see your player."
msgstr ""
"如果你的遊戲角色不是用貼圖顯示，而是用程式碼繪製，你也可以讓這段繪圖程式在編"

"``@tool`` scripts run inside the editor, and let you access the scene tree "
"of the currently edited scene. This is a powerful feature which also comes "
"with caveats, as the editor does not include protections for potential "
"misuse of ``@tool`` scripts. Be **extremely** cautious when manipulating the "
"scene tree, especially "
"via :ref:`Node.queue_free<class_Node_method_queue_free>`, as it can cause "
"crashes if you free a node while the editor runs logic involving it."
msgstr ""
"``@tool`` 腳本會在編輯器內執行，讓你能存取目前編輯中的場景樹。這是很強大的功"
"能，但也有風險，因為編輯器並不會防止 ``@tool`` 腳本的濫用。操作場景樹時要 **"

msgid ""
"The general rule is that **any other GDScript that your tool script uses "
"must *also* be a tool**. The editor is not able to construct instances from "
"GDScript files without ``@tool``, which means you cannot call methods or "
"reference member variables from them otherwise. However, since static "
"methods, constants and enums can be used without creating an instance, it is "
"possible to call them or reference them from a ``@tool`` script onto other "
"non-tool scripts. One exception to this are :ref:`static variables "
"<doc_gdscript_basics_static_variables>`. If you try to read a static "
"variable's value in a script that does not have ``@tool``, it will always "
"return ``null`` but won't print a warning or error when doing so. This "
"restriction does not apply to static methods, which can be called regardless "
"of whether the target script is in tool mode."
msgstr ""
"一般規則是：**工具腳本所使用的任何其他 GDScript 也必須是工具腳本**。編輯器無"
"法從沒有 ``@tool`` 的 GDScript 檔建立實例，這表示你無法呼叫其方法或存取其成員"
"變數。不過，由於靜態方法、常數與列舉可不建立實例即使用，因此可在 ``@tool`` 腳"
"本中呼叫或參照其他非工具腳本的這些成員。其中一個例外是 :ref:`靜態變數 "
"<doc_gdscript_basics_static_variables>`。如果你嘗試在沒有 ``@tool`` 的腳本中"
"讀取靜態變數的值，將一律回傳 ``null``，且不會顯示警告或錯誤。此限制不適用於靜"
"態方法；無論目標腳本是否為工具模式，都可以呼叫。"

msgid ""
"Extending a ``@tool`` script does not automatically make the extending "
"script a ``@tool``. Omitting ``@tool`` from the extending script will "
"disable tool behavior from the super class. Therefore, the extending script "
"should also specify the ``@tool`` annotation."
msgstr ""
"繼承自 ``@tool`` 腳本並不會自動讓子腳本成為 ``@tool``。若子腳本未標註 "
"``@tool``，父類別的工具行為會被停用。因此，繼承的腳本也應該標註 ``@tool``。"

msgid ""
"Modifications in the editor are permanent, with no undo/redo possible. For "
"example, in the next section when we remove the script, the node will keep "
"its rotation. Be careful to avoid making unwanted modifications. Consider "
"setting up :ref:`version control <doc_version_control_systems>` to avoid "
"losing work in case you make a mistake."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using the debugger and breakpoints on tool scripts is not currently "
