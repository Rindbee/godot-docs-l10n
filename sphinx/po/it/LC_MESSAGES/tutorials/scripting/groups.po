"Groups in Godot work like tags in other software. You can add a node to as "
"many groups as you want. Then, in code, you can use the SceneTree to:"

msgid "Call a method on all nodes in a group."

msgid "Send a notification to all nodes in a group."

"Groups are created by adding a node to a new group name, and likewise they "
"are removed by removing all nodes from a given group."

msgid "There are two ways to add/remove nodes to groups:"
msgstr "Ci sono due modi per farlo:"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"During design, by using the Node dock in the editor, or the Global Groups in "
"project settings."
msgstr "Usare il Node dock nell'editor."

msgid ""
"During execution, by calling :ref:`Node.add_to_group() "
"<class_Node_method_add_to_group>` or :ref:`Node.remove_from_group() "
"<class_Node_method_remove_from_group>`."

msgid "Using the Node dock"
msgstr "Utilizzo dell'editor Web"

msgid "You can create new groups using the Groups tab in the Node dock."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select one or more nodes in the Scene dock then click the add button with "
"the + symbol."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should now see the Create New Group modal appear. Write the group name "
"in the field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can optionally mark the option \"Global\", which will make the group "
"visible project-wide, and able to be reused in any project scene. This will "
"also allow you to give it a description."
msgstr ""

msgid "When done, press Ok to create it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should see the new groups appear in the Groups tab under Scene Groups if "
"the Global option was unmarked, or under Global Groups if that option was "
"marked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Selected Node(s) from the Scene dock can be added into groups by marking the "
"checkbox on the left side of the groups in the Groups dock. The node(s) you "
"had selected when creating a new group will be automatically checked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All groups present in the project that were marked as Global, created from "
"any scene, will be visible under Global Groups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any other group derived from nodes in the current scene will appear under "
"Scene Groups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same underlying logic is used for both Global and Scene groups. Groups "
"with the same name are considered one and the same. This feature is purely "
"organizational."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can manage Global Groups in the Global Groups dock, inside Project "
"Settings. There, you will be able to add new global groups, or change "
"existing groups' names and descriptions."

"You can also manage groups from scripts. The following code adds the node to "
"which you attach the script to the ``guards`` group as soon as it enters the "
"scene tree."
msgstr ""
"Ed il secondo modo è da codice. Il seguente script vorrebbe aggiungere il "
"nodo corrente al gruppo ``enemies`` appena appare nell'albero di scena."

msgid ""
"Imagine you're creating an infiltration game. When an enemy spots the "
"player, you want all guards and robots to be on alert."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the fictional example below, we use ``SceneTree.call_group()`` to alert "
"all enemies that the player was spotted."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The above code calls the function ``enter_alert_mode`` on every member of "
"the group ``guards``."
msgstr ""
"Il codice qua sopra chiama la funzione ``player_was_discovered`` su ogni "
"membro del gruppo ``enemies``."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"To get the full list of nodes in the ``guards`` group as an array, you can "
"call :ref:`SceneTree.get_nodes_in_group() "
"<class_SceneTree_method_get_nodes_in_group>`:"
msgstr ""
"È anche possibile acquisire la lista completa di nodi ``enemies`` chiamando :"
"ref:`SceneTree.get_nodes_in_group() "
"<class_SceneTree_method_get_nodes_in_group>`:"

"The :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` class provides many more useful "
"methods to interact with scenes, their node hierarchy, and groups. It allows "
"you to switch scenes easily or reload them, quit the game or pause and "
"unpause it. It also provides useful signals."
msgstr ""
"La classe :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` fornisce molti altri metodi "
"utili per interagire con le scene, la loro gerarchia di nodi e i gruppi. Ti "
"consente di cambiare facilmente le scene o ricaricarle, uscire dal gioco o "
"metterlo in pausa e riattivarlo. Fornisce anche segnali utili."
