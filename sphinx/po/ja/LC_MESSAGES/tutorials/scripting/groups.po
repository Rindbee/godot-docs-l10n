"Groups are created by adding a node to a new group name, and likewise they "
"are removed by removing all nodes from a given group."

msgid "There are two ways to add/remove nodes to groups:"
msgstr "これを行うには、次の 2 つの方法があります:"

"During design, by using the Node dock in the editor, or the Global Groups in "
"project settings."
msgstr "エディタのノードドックの使用。"

msgid ""
"During execution, by calling :ref:`Node.add_to_group() "

msgid "Using the Node dock"
msgstr "モジュールの使用"

msgid "You can create new groups using the Groups tab in the Node dock."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select one or more nodes in the Scene dock then click the add button with "
"the + symbol."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should now see the Create New Group modal appear. Write the group name "
"in the field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can optionally mark the option \"Global\", which will make the group "
"visible project-wide, and able to be reused in any project scene. This will "
"also allow you to give it a description."
msgstr ""

msgid "When done, press Ok to create it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should see the new groups appear in the Groups tab under Scene Groups if "
"the Global option was unmarked, or under Global Groups if that option was "
"marked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Selected Node(s) from the Scene dock can be added into groups by marking the "
"checkbox on the left side of the groups in the Groups dock. The node(s) you "
"had selected when creating a new group will be automatically checked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All groups present in the project that were marked as Global, created from "
"any scene, will be visible under Global Groups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any other group derived from nodes in the current scene will appear under "
"Scene Groups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same underlying logic is used for both Global and Scene groups. Groups "
"with the same name are considered one and the same. This feature is purely "
"organizational."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can manage Global Groups in the Global Groups dock, inside Project "
"Settings. There, you will be able to add new global groups, or change "
"existing groups' names and descriptions."

"You can also manage groups from scripts. The following code adds the node to "

"scene tree."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Imagine you're creating an infiltration game. When an enemy spots the "
"player, you want all guards and robots to be on alert."

msgid ""
"In the fictional example below, we use ``SceneTree.call_group()`` to alert "
"all enemies that the player was spotted."

"the group ``guards``."
msgstr ""
"上記のコードはグループ ``enemies`` のすべてのメンバーに対して関数 "

"The :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` class provides many more useful "
"methods to interact with scenes, their node hierarchy, and groups. It allows "
"you to switch scenes easily or reload them, quit the game or pause and "
"unpause it. It also provides useful signals."
