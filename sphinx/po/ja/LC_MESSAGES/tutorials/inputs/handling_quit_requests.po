"behavior to quit when quit is requested from the window manager. This can be "

msgid "On mobile devices"

msgid ""
"There is no direct equivalent to ``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` on mobile "
"platforms. Due to the nature of mobile operating systems, the only place "
"that you can run code prior to quitting is when the app is being suspended "
"to the background. On both Android and iOS, the app can be killed while "
"suspended at any time by either the user or the OS. A way to plan ahead for "
"this possibility is to utilize ``NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_PAUSED`` in order "
"to perform any needed actions as the app is being suspended."

"While forcing the application to close can be done by calling :ref:"
"`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>`, doing so will not send the "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` to the nodes in the scene tree. Quitting "
"by calling :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` will not "
"allow custom actions to complete (such as saving, confirming the quit, or "
"debugging), even if you try to delay the line that forces the quit."

"Instead, if you want to notify the nodes in the scene tree about the "
"upcoming program termination, you should send the notification yourself:"

msgid ""
"Sending this notification will inform all nodes about the program "
"termination, but will not terminate the program itself *unlike in 3.X*. In "
"order to achieve the previous behavior, :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` should be called after the notification."
