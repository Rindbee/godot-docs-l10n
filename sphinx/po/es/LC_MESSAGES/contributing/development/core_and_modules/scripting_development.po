"Create annotations for modifiers that act on the script or its code. "
"Additionally, create annotations for behavior that is specific to the Godot "
"engine and editor; if the primary purpose is to affect the way that the "
"engine or editor treats or interacts with the script, implement the token as "
"an annotation."

msgid "Do not create annotations for general programming language features."

msgid ""
"For historical reasons, some existing annotations and keywords do not "
"strictly follow these guidelines. Choosing between implementing a feature as "
"an annotation or as a language keyword is a nuanced decision that should be "
"made through discussion with other GDScript developers."
