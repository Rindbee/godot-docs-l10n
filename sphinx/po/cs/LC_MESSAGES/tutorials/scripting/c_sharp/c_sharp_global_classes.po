"If an :ref:`exported property <doc_c_sharp_exports>` is a global class, the "
"inspector restricts assignment, allowing only instances of that global class "
"or any derived classes."

msgid "Global classes are registered with the ``[GlobalClass]`` attribute."

"The ``MyNode`` type will be registered as a global class with the same name "
"as the type's name."

"The *Select a Node* window for the ``MyNode`` exported property filters the "
"list of nodes in the scene to match the assignment restriction."

"If a custom type isn't registered as a global class, the assignment is "
"restricted to the Godot type the custom type is based on. For example, "
"inspector assignments to an export of the type ``MySimpleSprite2D`` are "
"restricted to ``Sprite2D`` and derived types."

"When combined with the ``[GlobalClass]`` attribute, the ``[Icon]`` attribute "
"allows providing a path to an icon to show when the class is displayed in "
"the editor."

"The ``Stats`` class is a custom resource registered as a global class. :ref:"
"`Exporting properties <doc_c_sharp_exports>` of the type ``Stats`` will only "
"allow instances of this resource type to be assigned, and the inspector will "
"let you create and load instances of this type easily."
