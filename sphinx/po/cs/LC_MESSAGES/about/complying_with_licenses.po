msgid "What are licenses?"
msgstr "Co jsou Licence?"

msgid ""
"Godot is created and distributed under the `MIT License <https://opensource."
"org/licenses/MIT>`_. It doesn't have a sole owner, as every contributor that "
"submits code to the project does it under this same license and keeps "
"ownership of their contribution."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The license is the legal requirement for you (or your company) to use and "
"distribute the software (and derivative projects, including games made with "
"it). Your game or project can have a different license, but it still needs "
"to comply with the original one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This section covers compliance with licenses from a user perspective. If you "
"are interested in licence compliance as a contributor, you can find "
"guidelines :ref:`here "
"<doc_best_practices_for_engine_contributors_license_compliance>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alongside the Godot license text, remember to also list third-party notices "
"for assets you're using, such as textures, models, sounds, music and fonts. "
"This includes free assets, which often come with licenses that require "
"attribution."
msgstr ""

msgid "Requirements"
msgstr "Nároky"

"In the case of the MIT license, the only requirement is to include the "
"license text somewhere in your game or derivative project."

msgstr "Nejčastější případy použití jsou následující:"

msgid ""
"Beside its own MIT license, Godot includes code from a number of third-party "
"libraries. See :ref:`doc_complying_with_licenses_thirdparty` for details."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Your games do not need to be under the same license. You are free to release "
"your Godot projects under any license and to create commercial games with "
"the engine."

"The license text must be made available to the user. The license doesn't "
"specify how the text has to be included, but here are the most common "
"approaches (you only need to implement one of them, not all)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Credits screen"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Include the above license text somewhere in the credits screen. It can be at "
"the bottom after showing the rest of the credits. Most large studios use "
"this approach with open source licenses."
msgstr ""

msgid "Licenses screen"
msgstr "Obrazovka licencí"

msgid ""
"Some games have a special menu (often in the settings) to display licenses. "
"This menu is typically accessed with a button called **Third-party "
"Licenses** or **Open Source Licenses**."
msgstr ""

msgid "Output log"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Printing the license text using the :ref:`print() "
"<class_@GlobalScope_method_print>` function may be enough on platforms where "
"a global output log is readable. This is the case on desktop platforms, "
"Android and HTML5 (but not iOS)."

msgid "Accompanying file"

"If the game is distributed on desktop platforms, a file containing the "

"If the game includes a printed manual, the license text can be included "
"there."

msgid "Link to the license"
msgstr "Odkaz na licenci"

"The Godot Engine developers consider that a link to ``godotengine.org/"
"license`` in your game documentation or credits would be an acceptable way "
"to satisfy the license terms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot provides several methods to get license information in the :ref:"
"`Engine <class_Engine>` singleton. This allows you to source the license "
"information directly from the engine binary, which prevents the information "
"from becoming outdated if you update engine versions."

"A good option for end users to document third-party licenses is to include "
