msgid "Submitting to the Asset Library"
msgstr "提交到素材庫"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"This tutorial aims to serve as a guide on how you can submit your own assets "
"to the `Godot Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_ "
"and share them with the Godot community."
msgstr ""
"本教學將引導你如何將自己的素材提交到 `Godot 素材庫 <https://godotengine.org/"
"asset-library/asset>`_，並與 Godot 社群分享。"

msgid ""
"As mentioned in the :ref:`doc_using_assetlib` document, in order to be able "
"to submit assets to the AssetLib, you need to have a registered account, and "
"be logged in."
msgstr ""
"如同 :ref:`doc_using_assetlib` 文件中所述，若要提交素材至 AssetLib，你必須先"
"註冊帳號並登入。"

msgid "Submission guidelines"
msgstr "提交指引"

msgid ""
"Before submitting your asset, please ensure it follows all of the "
"requirements, and also consider following the recommendations."
msgstr "在提交你的素材前，請確認已符合所有必要條件，也建議參考下方的推薦做法。"

msgid "Requirements"
msgstr "系統需求"

msgid ""
"Generally speaking, most assets people submit to the asset library are "
"accepted. However, in order for your asset to be accepted, there are a few "
"requirements your asset needs to meet to be approved."
msgstr ""
"一般來說，大多數提交到素材庫的資源都會被接受。但你的素材仍必須符合幾項審核條"
"件，才有可能通過審查。"

msgid ""
"The asset must **work**. If the asset doesn't run or otherwise doesn't work "
"in the specified Godot version, then it will be rejected."
msgstr ""
"素材必須**可以運作**。如果素材無法執行，或是在指定 Godot 版本下不能正常運作，"
"將會被退件。"

msgid ""
"The asset must have a proper **.gitignore** file. It's important to keep "
"redundant data out of the repository. `Here's a template. <https://"
"raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronfranke/gitignore/godot/Godot.gitignore>`_"
msgstr ""
"素材必須包含正確的 **.gitignore** 檔案。保持倉庫乾淨、避免冗餘資料十分重要。`"
"這裡有一個範本 <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaronfranke/gitignore/"
"godot/Godot.gitignore>`_"

msgid ""
"No **submodules**, or any submodules must be non-essential. GitHub does not "
"include submodules in the downloaded ZIP file, so if the asset needs the "
"contents of the submodule, your asset won't work."
msgstr ""
"不得包含**子模組**，或者任何子模組都必須是非必要的。GitHub 下載的 ZIP 檔不含"
"子模組，因此若你的素材依賴子模組內容，將無法正常運作。"

msgid ""
"The **license** needs to be correct. The license listed on the asset library "
"must match the license in the repository. The repo MUST have a license file, "
"called either \"LICENSE\" or \"LICENSE.md\". This file must contain the "
"license text itself and a copyright statement that includes the year(s) and "
"copyright holder."
msgstr ""
"**授權條款** 必須正確。素材庫內所標示的授權，必須與倉庫內的授權檔一致。倉庫必"
"須包含名為「LICENSE」或「LICENSE.md」的檔案，其中須有授權條款全文，以及含有年"
"份與著作權人名稱的版權聲明。"

msgid ""
"Use proper **English** for the name and description of your asset. This "
"includes using correct capitalization, and using full sentences in the "
"description. You can also include other languages, but there should at least "
"be an English version."
msgstr ""
"素材名稱和描述請使用正確的**英文**。內容應有正確大小寫與完整句子。你亦可提供"
"其他語言版本，但至少需有英文。"

msgid ""
"The icon link must be a **direct link**. For icons hosted on GitHub, the "
"link must start with \"raw.githubusercontent.com\", not \"github.com\"."
msgstr ""
"圖示連結必須為**直接連結**。若圖示存放於 GitHub，連結須以"
"「raw.githubusercontent.com」開頭，而非「github.com」。"

msgid "Recommendations"
msgstr "建議"

msgid ""
"These things are not required for your asset to be approved, but if you "
"follow these recommendations, you can help make the asset library a better "
"place for all users."
msgstr "這些項目雖非必要條件，但若能遵循，將有助於素材庫生態更完善。"

msgid ""
"When creating non-project assets, it is common practice to place your files "
"inside of an **addons/asset_name/** folder. Do this to avoid having your "
"files clash with other assets, or with the files of users installing your "
"asset. This folder will **not** be automatically generated when a user "
"installs your asset."
msgstr ""
"建立非專案素材時，建議將檔案放在 **addons/素材名稱/** 資料夾下，以避免與其他"
"素材或使用者自身的檔案發生衝突。請注意，當使用者安裝你的素材時，這個資料夾**"
"不會**自動建立。"

msgid ""
"Fix or suppress all script **warnings**. The warning system is there to help "
"identify issues with your code, but people using your asset don't need to "
"see them."
msgstr ""
"修正或隱藏所有腳本**警告**。警告機制是協助你檢查程式碼用的，但素材使用者不該"
"看到這些警告。"

msgid ""
"Make your code conform to the official **style guides**. Having a consistent "
"style helps other people read your code, and it also helps if other people "
"wish to contribute to your asset. See: the :ref:`doc_gdscript_styleguide` or "
"the :ref:`doc_c_sharp_styleguide`."
msgstr ""
"請讓你的程式碼符合官方**風格指南**。統一的程式風格有助於他人閱讀、或未來貢"
"獻。參見 :ref:`doc_gdscript_styleguide` 或 :ref:`doc_c_sharp_styleguide`。"

msgid ""
"If you have screenshots in your repo, place them in their own subfolder and "
"add an empty **.gdignore** file in the same folder (note: **gd**, not "
"**git**). This prevents Godot from importing your screenshots. On Windows, "
"open a command prompt in the project folder and run ``type nul > .gdignore`` "
"to create a file whose name starts with a period."
msgstr ""
"若倉庫中有截圖，請放在獨立子資料夾，並在該資料夾內加一個空的 **.gdignore** 檔"
"（注意是 **gd**，不是 **git**）。這樣可避免 Godot 匯入你的截圖。Windows 系統"
"下，可在專案資料夾命令提示字元輸入 ``type nul > .gdignore`` 來建立此檔案。"

msgid ""
"If your asset is a library for working with other files, consider including "
"**example files** in the asset."
msgstr "若你的素材是用於處理其他檔案的函式庫，建議附上**範例檔案**。"

msgid ""
"Consider adding a **.gitattributes** file to your repo. This file allows "
"giving extra instructions to Git, such as specifying line endings and "
"listing files not required for your asset to function with the ``export-"
"ignore`` directive. This directive removes such files from the resulting ZIP "
"file, preventing them from being downloaded by the asset library users. "
"These are common examples of **.gitattributes**:"
msgstr ""
"建議你在倉庫中新增 **.gitattributes** 檔案。這個檔案可提供 Git 額外指示，例如"
"指定行尾格式，或利用 ``export-ignore`` 指令排除素材運作不需的檔案。被排除的檔"
"案不會包含在下載的 ZIP 中，也就不會被素材庫使用者下載。以下是一些常見的 "
"**.gitattributes** 範例："

msgid "Projects / Templates"
msgstr "專案 / 範本"

msgid "Addons / Asset Packs"
msgstr "外掛 / 素材包"

msgid ""
"If you are submitting a plugin, add a **copy** of your license and readme to "
"the plugin folder itself. This is the folder that users are guaranteed to "
"keep with their project, so a copy ensures they always have those files "
"handy (and helps them fulfill your licensing terms)."
msgstr ""
"若你提交的是外掛，請於外掛資料夾內附上一份授權和說明文件的**副本**。這樣可確"
"保使用者日後保有這些檔案，並便於他們遵守你的授權規定。"

msgid ""
"While the asset library allows more than just GitHub, consider hosting your "
"asset's source code on **GitHub**. Other services may not work reliably, and "
"a lack of familiarity can be a barrier to contributors."
msgstr ""
"素材庫除了 GitHub 外也支援其他平台，但建議將原始碼託管在 **GitHub**。其他平台"
"穩定性較差或不易被貢獻者使用。"

msgid "Submitting"
msgstr "提交"

msgid ""
"Once you are logged in, you will be able to head over to the \"Submit "
"Assets\" page of the AssetLib, which will look like this:"
msgstr ""
"當你登入後，就可以前往 AssetLib 的「Submit Assets」（提交素材）頁面，如下圖所"
"示："

msgid "|image0|"
msgstr "\\ |image0|"

msgid "image0"
msgstr "image0"

msgid ""
"While it may look like a lot (and there is more as you scroll down), each "
"field is described in terms of what you should put in. We will nonetheless "
"go over what is required in the submission form here as well."
msgstr ""
"表單看似項目繁多（往下捲動會有更多欄位），但每個項目都有說明應填內容。以下我"
"們也會逐項說明提交表單需填寫的資訊。"

msgid "**Asset Name**:"
msgstr "**素材名稱**："

msgid ""
"The name of your asset. Should be a unique, descriptive title of what your "
"asset is."
msgstr "你的素材名稱。應為唯一且具描述性的標題。"

msgid "**Category**:"
msgstr "**分類**："

msgid ""
"The category that your asset belongs to, and will be shown in search "
"results. The category is split into **Addons** and **Projects**. In-editor, "
"assets of the Project type (Templates, Demos, Projects) only show up when "
"viewing the AssetLib from the Project Manager, while assets of the Addon "
"type will only be visible from inside a project."
msgstr ""
"素材所屬分類，會顯示於搜尋結果。分類分為 **Addons** （外掛）和 **Projects** "
"（專案）。專案類型（範本、展示、專案）僅在專案管理員中看到；外掛類型僅會在專"
"案內部看見。"

msgid "**Godot version**:"
msgstr "**Godot 版本**："

msgid ""
"The version of the engine that the asset works with. Currently, it's not "
"possible to have a single asset entry contain downloads for multiple engine "
"versions, so you may need to re-submit the asset multiple times, with an "
"entry for each Godot version it supports. This is particularly important "
"when dealing with major versions of the engine, such as Godot 2.x and Godot "
"3.x."
msgstr ""
"素材支援的引擎版本。目前無法在單一素材條目下提供多個版本下載，因此需針對每個"
"Godot 版本分別提交。這在主要版本（如 Godot 2.x 與 3.x）間尤其重要。"

msgid "**Version**:"
msgstr "**版本號**："

msgid ""
"The version number of the asset. While you are free to choose and use any "
"versioning scheme that you like, you may want to look into something such as "
"`SemVer <https://semver.org>`_ if you want your asset's versioning scheme to "
"be clear and consistent. Note that there is also an internal version number, "
"incremented every time the asset download URL is changed or updated."
msgstr ""
"素材的版本號。你可以用任何你喜歡的版本編號方式，但若想更清楚一致，建議參考 "
"`SemVer <https://semver.org>`_。此外，每次下載網址異動時，系統會自動增加一組"
"內部版本號。"

msgid "**Repository host**:"
msgstr "**倉庫平台**："

msgid ""
"Assets uploaded to the AssetLib are not hosted on it directly. Instead, they "
"point to repositories hosted on third-party Git providers, such as GitHub, "
"GitLab or Bitbucket. This is where you choose which provider your asset "
"uses, so the site can compute the final download link."
msgstr ""
"提交到 AssetLib 的素材不會直接託管於平台上，而是指向第三方 Git 倉庫（如 "
"GitHub、GitLab 或 Bitbucket）。此處需選擇你的素材所在的平台，以便系統產生正確"
"的下載連結。"

msgid "**Repository URL**:"
msgstr "**倉庫網址**："

msgid ""
"The URL to your asset's files/webpage. This will vary based on your choice "
"of provider, but it should look similar to `https://github.com/<user>/"
"<project>`."
msgstr ""
"你的素材檔案／專案頁網址。格式依平台不同，大致類似 `https://github.com/<使用"
"者>/<專案>`。"

msgid "**Issues URL**:"
msgstr "**問題追蹤網址**："

msgid ""
"The URL to your asset's issue tracker. Again, this will differ from "
"repository host to repository host, but will likely look similar to `https://"
"github.com/<user>/<project>/issues`. You may leave this field empty if you "
"use your provider's issue tracker, and it's part of the same repository."
msgstr ""
"素材的問題追蹤系統網址。依平台不同，格式大致為 `https://github.com/<使用者>/<"
"專案>/issues`。若你使用的問題追蹤器已內建於該倉庫，也可留空此欄。"

msgid "**Download Commit**:"
msgstr "**下載 Commit**："

msgid ""
"The commit of the asset. For example, "
"`b1d3172f89b86e52465a74f63a74ac84c491d3e1`. The site computes the actual "
"download URL from this."
msgstr ""
"素材的提交版本（Commit）。例如：`b1d3172f89b86e52465a74f63a74ac84c491d3e1`。"
"系統會以此產生實際下載網址。"

msgid "**Icon URL**:"
msgstr "**圖示網址**："

msgid ""
"The URL to your asset's icon (which will be used as a thumbnail in the "
"AssetLib search results and on the asset's page). Should be an image in "
"either the PNG or JPG format."
msgstr ""
"素材圖示的網址（將做為 AssetLib 搜尋結果與素材頁面的縮圖）。圖示需為 PNG 或 "
"JPG 格式。"

msgid ""
"The **icon** must be square (1:1 aspect ratio). It should have a minimum "
"resolution of 128×128 pixels."
msgstr "**圖示** 必須為正方形（1:1 比例），最小解析度應為 128×128 像素。"

msgid ""
"For icons hosted on GitHub, URLs must be provided in the form of `https://"
"raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<project>/<branch>/Icon.png`."

msgid "**License**:"
msgstr "**授權條款**："

msgid ""
"The license under which you are distributing the asset. The list includes a "
"variety of free and open source software licenses, such as GPL (v2 and v3), "
"MIT, BSD and Boost Software License. You can visit `OpenSource.org <https://"
"opensource.org>`_ for a detailed description of each of the listed licenses."
msgstr ""

"開源授權。詳細說明請參考 `OpenSource.org <https://opensource.org>`_。"

msgid "**Description**:"
msgstr "**描述**："

msgid ""
"Finally, you can use the Description field for a textual overview of your "
"asset, its features and behavior, a changelog, et cetera. In the future, "
"formatting with Markdown will be supported, but currently, your only option "
"is plain text."
msgstr ""
"最後，你可以在「描述」欄位中簡述素材特性、功能、行為與更新紀錄等。未來將支援 "
"Markdown 格式，目前僅支援純文字。"

msgid ""
"You may also include up to three video and/or image previews, which will be "
"shown at the bottom of the asset page. Use the \"Enable\" checkbox on each "
"of the preview submission boxes to enable them."
msgstr ""

msgstr "圖片連結，將用作預覽縮圖。此選項未來會移除，屆時縮圖將自動產生。"

msgid ""
"Once you are done, press \"Submit\". Your asset will be entered into the "
"review queue. You can check all assets currently pending a review `here "
"<https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/edit?&asset=-1>`_ . The "
