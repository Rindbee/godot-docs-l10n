"Godot is created and distributed under the `MIT License <https://opensource."
"org/licenses/MIT>`_. It doesn't have a sole owner, as every contributor that "
"submits code to the project does it under this same license and keeps "
"ownership of their contribution."
msgstr ""
"Godot 是根據 `MIT License <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ 建立並分發"
"的。它也沒有唯一的所有者，因為向該專案提交程式碼的每個貢獻者都在相同的許可證"
"下執行該程式碼，並保留貢獻的所有權。"

msgid ""
"The license is the legal requirement for you (or your company) to use and "
"distribute the software (and derivative projects, including games made with "
"it). Your game or project can have a different license, but it still needs "
"to comply with the original one."
msgstr ""
"許可證是您（或您的公司）使用和分發軟體（以及衍生專案，包括用它製作的遊戲）的"
"法律要求。您的遊戲或專案可以具有不同的許可證，但仍需要遵守原始許可證。"

"are interested in licence compliance as a contributor, you can find "
