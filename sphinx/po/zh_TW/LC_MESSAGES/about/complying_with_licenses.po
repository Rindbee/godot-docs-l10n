"本頁面的建議 **並非法律意見** 。這些建議是基於善意提供，旨在協助使用者了解授"
"權歸屬的要求。"

msgid "What are licenses?"
msgstr "什麼是許可證？"

msgid ""
"Godot is created and distributed under the `MIT License <https://"
"opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_. It doesn't have a sole owner, as every "
"contributor that submits code to the project does it under this same license "
"and keeps ownership of their contribution."
msgstr ""
"Godot 是依據 `MIT 授權條款 <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_ 建立並發布"
"的。它沒有單一擁有者，因為每一位提交程式碼給專案的貢獻者，都是在此授權條款下"
"進行，並保留其貢獻的所有權。"

msgid ""
"The license is the legal requirement for you (or your company) to use and "
"distribute the software (and derivative projects, including games made with "
"it). Your game or project can have a different license, but it still needs "
"to comply with the original one."
msgstr ""
"許可證是您（或您的公司）使用和分發軟體（以及衍生專案，包括用它製作的遊戲）的"
"法律要求。您的遊戲或專案可以具有不同的許可證，但仍需要遵守原始許可證。"

msgid ""
"This section covers compliance with licenses from a user perspective. If you "
"are interested in licence compliance as a contributor, you can find "
"guidelines :ref:`here "
"<doc_best_practices_for_engine_contributors_license_compliance>`."
msgstr ""
"本節從使用者的角度介紹了許可證合規性。 如果你作為貢獻者對許可證合規性感興趣，"
"可以在 :ref:`這裡 "
"<doc_best_practices_for_engine_contributors_license_compliance>` 找到指南說"
"明。"

msgid ""
"Alongside the Godot license text, remember to also list third-party notices "
"for assets you're using, such as textures, models, sounds, music and fonts. "
"This includes free assets, which often come with licenses that require "
"attribution."
msgstr ""
"除了 Godot 授權條款的文字之外，也請記得列出您使用的第三方素材的版權聲明，例如"
"材質、模型、音效、音樂和字型。這包括免費素材，因為它們通常也附帶需要標註出處"
"的授權條款。"

msgid "Requirements"
msgstr "系統需求"

msgid ""
"In the case of the MIT license, the only requirement is to include the "
"license text somewhere in your game or derivative project."
msgstr "對於MIT許可證，唯一的要求是將許可證文字包含在您的遊戲或衍生專案中。"

msgid ""
"Beside its own MIT license, Godot includes code from a number of third-party "
"libraries. See :ref:`doc_complying_with_licenses_thirdparty` for details."
msgstr ""
"除了自身的 MIT 授權條款之外，Godot 也包含來自許多第三方函式庫的程式碼。詳情請"
"參閱 :ref:`doc_complying_with_licenses_thirdparty`。"

msgid ""
"Your games do not need to be under the same license. You are free to release "
"your Godot projects under any license and to create commercial games with "
"the engine."
msgstr ""
"您的遊戲無需遵循相同的許可證。您可以選擇任意許可證自由地發行自己的 Godot 專"
"案，並使用該引擎建立商業遊戲。"

msgid "Inclusion"
msgstr "包含"

msgid ""
"The license text must be made available to the user. The license doesn't "
"specify how the text has to be included, but here are the most common "
"approaches (you only need to implement one of them, not all)."
msgstr ""
"授權條款的內容必須提供給使用者。授權條款並未明確規定必須如何包含這些內容，但"
"以下是最常見的做法（您只需要實作其中一種，不必全部都實作）。"

msgid "Credits screen"
msgstr "製作人員名單畫面"

msgid ""
"Include the above license text somewhere in the credits screen. It can be at "
"the bottom after showing the rest of the credits. Most large studios use "
"this approach with open source licenses."
msgstr ""
"將上述授權條款文字放在製作人員名單畫面中的某處。可以放在顯示完其他製作人員名"
"單的底部。大多數大型工作室都使用這種處理開放原始碼授權的方式。"

msgid "Licenses screen"
msgstr "授權"

msgid ""
"Some games have a special menu (often in the settings) to display licenses. "
"This menu is typically accessed with a button called **Third-party "
"Licenses** or **Open Source Licenses**."

"**協力廠商協定** 或者 **開源協定** 按鈕存取。"

msgid "Output log"
msgstr "輸出紀錄"

msgid ""
"Printing the license text using the :ref:`print() "
"<class_@GlobalScope_method_print>` function may be enough on platforms where "
"a global output log is readable. This is the case on desktop platforms, "
"Android and HTML5 (but not iOS)."
msgstr ""
"在可讀取全域輸出日誌的平台上，使用 :ref:`print() "
"<class_@GlobalScope_method_print>` 函式印出授權條款文字或許就足夠了。桌面平"
"台、Android 和 HTML5 屬於這種情況（但不包括 iOS）。"

msgid "Accompanying file"
msgstr "附帶檔案"

msgid ""
"If the game is distributed on desktop platforms, a file containing the "
"license text can be added to the software that is installed to the user PC."
msgstr ""
"如果遊戲發布在桌上型平台，可以將包含授權條款內容的檔案加入到安裝至使用者電腦"
"的軟體中。"

"there."
msgstr "如果遊戲包含印刷手冊，授權條款的文字可以放在手冊中。"

msgid "Link to the license"
msgstr "同意授權條款"

msgid ""
"The Godot Engine developers consider that a link to ``godotengine.org/"
"license`` in your game documentation or credits would be an acceptable way "
"to satisfy the license terms."
msgstr ""
"Godot 引擎開發者認為，在你遊戲的文件或者製作組資訊中加入指向 "
"``godotengine.org/license`` 的連結就可以滿足許可證的條款。"

msgid ""
"Godot provides several methods to get license information in "
"the :ref:`Engine <class_Engine>` singleton. This allows you to source the "
"license information directly from the engine binary, which prevents the "
"information from becoming outdated if you update engine versions."
msgstr ""
"Godot 提供了數種方法，能從 :ref:`Engine <class_Engine>` 單例模式取得授權資"
"訊。這讓您可以直接從引擎二進制檔案取得授權資訊，避免在更新引擎版本後資訊過"
"時。"

msgid "For the engine itself:"
msgstr "對於引擎自己："

msgid "Third-party licenses"
msgstr "第三方工具"

msgid ""
"Godot itself contains software written by `third parties <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot/blob/master/thirdparty/README.md>`_, which is compatible "
"with, but not covered by Godot's MIT license."
msgstr ""
"Godot 本身包含由 `第三方 <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/"
"thirdparty/README.md>`_ 撰寫的軟體，這些軟體與 Godot 的 MIT 授權條款相容，但"
"不屬於其涵蓋範圍。"

msgid ""
"Many of these dependencies are distributed under permissive open source "
"licenses which require attribution by explicitly citing their copyright "
"statement and license text in the final product's documentation."
msgstr ""
"這些依賴項目中，許多是以寬鬆的開放原始碼授權條款發布的，這些條款要求在最終產"
"品的文件中明確引用其著作權聲明和授權條款來進行歸屬。"

msgid ""
"Given the scope of the Godot project, this is fairly difficult to do "
"thoroughly. For the Godot editor, the full documentation of third-party "
"copyrights and licenses is provided in the `COPYRIGHT.txt <https://"
"github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.txt>`_ file."
msgstr ""
"考量到 Godot 專案的規模，要徹底做到這一點相當困難。關於 Godot 編輯器，第三方"
"版權和授權的完整文件已提供於 `COPYRIGHT.txt <https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.txt>`_ 檔案中。"

msgid ""
"A good option for end users to document third-party licenses is to include "
"this file in your project's distribution, which you can e.g. rename to "
"``GODOT_COPYRIGHT.txt`` to prevent any confusion with your own code and "
"assets."
msgstr ""
"對於終端使用者來說，記錄第三方授權的一個好方法是將此檔案包含在您的專案發布版"
"本中，您可以將其重新命名為 ``GODOT_COPYRIGHT.txt`` ，以避免與您自己的程式碼和"
"素材產生混淆。"
