"Create annotations for modifiers that act on the script or its code. "
"Additionally, create annotations for behavior that is specific to the Godot "
"engine and editor; if the primary purpose is to affect the way that the "
"engine or editor treats or interacts with the script, implement the token as "
"an annotation."
msgstr ""
"為作用於腳本或其程式碼的修飾符建立註解。此外，針對 Godot 引擎與編輯器專屬的行"
"為，也應建立註解；如果主要目的是影響引擎或編輯器處理或互動腳本的方式，則應將"
"該標記實作為註解。"

msgid "Do not create annotations for general programming language features."
msgstr "不要為一般程式語言特性建立註解。"

msgid ""
"For historical reasons, some existing annotations and keywords do not "
"strictly follow these guidelines. Choosing between implementing a feature as "
"an annotation or as a language keyword is a nuanced decision that should be "
"made through discussion with other GDScript developers."
msgstr ""
"由於歷史原因，部分現有的註解與關鍵字並未嚴格遵循這些方針。針對某功能應實作為"
"註解還是語言關鍵字，這需要與其他 GDScript 開發者討論後，再做出細緻的決定。"
