msgid "TSCN file format"
msgstr "TSCN 檔案格式"

msgid ""
"The TSCN (text scene) file format represents a single scene tree inside "
"Godot. Unlike binary SCN files, TSCN files have the advantage of being "
"mostly human-readable and easy for version control systems to manage."
msgstr ""
"TSCN（Text SCeNe）檔案格式代表 Godot 中的一個單一場景樹。與二進位 SCN 檔不"
"同，TSCN 檔案主要具備可供人閱讀、方便版本控制的優勢。"

msgid ""
"The ESCN (exported scene) file format is identical to the TSCN file format, "
"but is used to indicate to Godot that the file has been exported from "
"another program and should not be edited by the user from within Godot. "
"Unlike SCN and TSCN files, during import, ESCN files are compiled to binary "
"SCN files stored inside the ``.godot/imported/`` folder. This reduces the "
"data size and speeds up loading, as binary formats are faster to load "
"compared to text-based formats."
msgstr ""
"ESCN（Exported SCeNe）檔案格式與 TSCN 完全相容，但用於標示此檔案為從其他程式"
"匯出，不應在 Godot 內被編輯。與 SCN/TSCN 不同，ESCN 在匯入時會被編譯為二進位 "
"SCN 檔，儲存在 ``.godot/imported/`` 資料夾中，這有助於減少資料大小並加速載"
"入。"

msgid ""
"To make files more compact, properties equal to the default value are not "
"stored in scene/resource files. It is possible to write them manually, but "
"they will be discarded when saving the file."
msgstr ""
"為了讓檔案更精簡，等於預設值的屬性不會儲存在場景/資源檔內。雖然可以手動寫入，"
"但在儲存時會被自動移除。"

"For those looking for a complete description, the parsing is handled in the "
"file `resource_format_text.cpp <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/"

"``ResourceFormatLoaderText`` class."

"The scene and resource file formats have changed significantly in Godot 4, "
"with the introduction of string-based UIDs to replace incremental integer "
"IDs."
msgstr ""
"Godot 4 的場景與資源檔案格式有重大變動，新增以字串為基礎的 UID，以取代以往的"

msgid "External resources"
msgstr "外部資源"

msgid "Internal resources"
msgstr "內部資源"

msgid "Nodes"
msgstr "節點"

msgid "Connections"
msgstr "連線"

msgid ""
"The file descriptor looks like ``[gd_scene load_steps=4 format=3 uid=\"uid://"
"cecaux1sm7mo0\"]`` and should be the first entry in the file. The "
"``load_steps`` parameter is equal to the total amount of resources (internal "
"and external) plus one (for the file itself). If the file has no resources, "
"``load_steps`` is omitted. The engine will still load the file correctly if "
"``load_steps`` is incorrect, but this will affect loading bars and any other "
"piece of code relying on that value."
msgstr ""
"檔案描述元會像 ``[gd_scene load_steps=4 format=3 uid=\"uid://xxx\"]``，必須放"
"在檔案最前方。``load_steps`` 數值為所有（內外部）資源數加一（自身），若無資源"
"則可省略。即使 ``load_steps`` 值不正確，Godot 仍可正確載入檔案，但這會影響載"
"入進度條與依賴該數值的程式。"

msgid ""
"``uid`` is a unique string-based identifier representing the scene. This is "
"used by the engine to track files that are moved around, even while the "
"editor is closed. Scripts can also load UID-based resources using the "
"``uid://`` path prefix to avoid relying on filesystem paths. This makes it "
"possible to move around a file in the project, but still be able to load it "
"in scripts without having to modify the script. Godot does not use external "
"files to keep track of IDs, which means no central metadata storage location "
"is required within the project. See `this pull request <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot/pull/50786>`__ for detailed information."
msgstr ""
"``uid`` 是用來代表場景的唯一字串識別碼。引擎會用來追蹤檔案位置變動，即使編輯"
"器關閉也一樣。腳本可透過 ``uid://`` 路徑前綴載入 UID 資源，無需依賴檔案系統路"
"徑，方便專案內移動資源又不需修改腳本。Godot 不用外部檔案記錄 ID，因此不需專案"
"內存在中央 metadata。詳情見此 pull request：<https://github.com/godotengine/"
"godot/pull/50786>。"

msgid ""
"These sections should appear in order, but it can be hard to distinguish "
"them. The only difference between them is the first element in the heading "
"for all of the items in the section. For example, the heading of all "
"external resources should start with ``[ext_resource ...]``."
msgstr ""
"這些區段應依順序出現，但區分上可能有些困難。區段的差別主要在於每個專案標頭的"
"首個元素。例如，所有外部資源的標頭皆以 ``[ext_resource ...]`` 開始。"

msgid ""
"A TSCN file may contain single-line comments starting with a semicolon "
"(``;``). However, comments will be discarded when saving the file using the "
"Godot editor. Whitespace within a TSCN file is not significant (except "
"within strings), but extraneous whitespace will be discarded when saving the "
"file."
msgstr ""
"TSCN 檔案可包含以分號（``;``）開頭的單行註解，但以 Godot 編輯器儲存時註解會被"
