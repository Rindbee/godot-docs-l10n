"A full tutorial on creating outlines is not provided here, we recommend "

"transparency value like in Inkscape). This color was chosen specifically to "
"make sure color blind people do not have issues reading the documentation, "
"other colors can be used in addition to this yellow if multiple outlines on "
"an image are needed, red should be avoided. The second standard is that all "
"outlines and arrow lines should be 2 pixels wide."

"``fffb44ff`` ）。選擇這種顏色是為了確保色盲在閱讀文件時不會遇到問題，如果需要"
"在圖像上使用多個輪廓，則除了這種黃色之外，還可以使用其他顏色，應避免使用紅"
"色。第二個標準是所有的輪廓和箭頭線都應該是 2 像素寬。"

msgid ""
"Finally, some images might require text to differentiate multiple parts of "
"an image. There are no strict requirements other than use an easy to read "
"non fancy font. As for color the yellow color from before should also be "
"used, but black or other colors can be used if appropriate. For example, if "
"yellow blends into the image, or if there are multiple outlines in multiple "
"colors."
msgstr ""
"最後，一些圖像可能需要文字來區分圖像的多個部分。除了使用易讀的非花哨字形外，"
"沒有其他嚴格的要求。至於顏色，也應該使用以前的黃色，但如果合適，可以使用黑色"
"或其他顏色。例如，如果黃色混合到圖像中，或者如果存在多種顏色的多個輪廓。"
