msgid "Images"
msgstr "影像"

msgid "Capturing an image"
msgstr "截取影像"

msgid ""
"To take a picture of something in Godot, a screen capture tool can be used."
msgstr "若要在 Godot 中截圖，可使用螢幕擷取工具。"

msgid ""
"On Windows 10 and 11 that would be the Snip & Sketch program. "
"Pressing :kbd:`Windows + Shift + S` lets you take a screenshot of a portion "
"of the screen and save it to the clipboard. After pressing those keys, click "
"and drag over the area you wish to take a picture of."
msgstr ""
"在 Windows 10 和 11 上，推薦使用 Snip & Sketch 程式。按下 :kbd:`Windows + "
"Shift + S` 可擷取部分螢幕並自動儲存到剪貼簿。按下這組快捷鍵後，點擊並拖曳你想"
"擷取的區域。"

msgid ""
"On macOS, pressing :kbd:`Shift + Command + 3` does the same. To take a "
"picture of the entire screen press :kbd:`Shift + Command + 4`. All "
"screenshots taken will be saved to the desktop."
msgstr ""
"在 macOS 上，按 :kbd:`Shift + Command + 3` 可擷取整個螢幕。若要擷取指定區域，"
"請按 :kbd:`Shift + Command + 4`。所有截圖都會儲存到桌面。"

msgid ""
"Each Linux desktop environment has it's own screenshot tool. For example, on "
"KDE Plasma the program Spectacle is used for taking screenshots. If your "
"distribution doesn't come with one by default try searching its package "
"repository, or Flathub if that's supported."
msgstr ""
"各個 Linux 桌面環境都有自己的截圖工具。例如，在 KDE Plasma 上可使用 "
"Spectacle。如果你的發行版沒有預設安裝，請到套件庫或 Flathub 搜尋。"

msgid ""
"All screenshots should ideally be taken on a 1080p screen. Anything higher "
"resolution is adding detail that doesn't make the documentation better and "
"dramatically increases file size. If you're taking screenshots on a higher "
"resolution screen the screenshot should be scaled down. There are "
"instructions on how to do this later on this page."
msgstr ""
"理想上，所有截圖都應該在 1080p 螢幕上擷取。更高解析度只會增加檔案大小，並不會"
"讓文件更好。如果你在高解析度的螢幕截圖，請將影像縮小。這頁後面會有相關說明。"

msgid "Format conversion"
msgstr "格式轉換"

msgid ""
"The current format for images in Godot's documentation is WebP (``.webp``). "
"While some Linux programs will support saving screenshots in this format, "
"macOS and the Snip & Sketch program on Windows do not. For images that don't "
"need editing, such as precise cropping or adding outlines, Squoosh can be "
"used. `Squoosh <https://squoosh.app/>`_ is a converter developed by Google, "
"is open source, and doesn't give Google any image rights by using it. When "
"choosing compression if you can get an image that's under 300KB in size use "
"lossless compression. If it's over 300KB, use just enough lossy compression "
"to get it under that size. If this results in noticeable compression "
"artifacts using less compression is fine, even if the file size is bigger."
msgstr ""
"Godot 文件目前採用的圖片格式為 WebP（``.webp``）。雖然部分 Linux 程式可直接存"

"將其降到 300KB 以下。如果這樣會造成明顯壓縮痕跡，即使檔案大一點也沒關係。"

msgid ""
"If you already have an image editor such as GIMP, Krita or Photoshop "
"installed it may have the ability to open an image then save it as a WebP "
"file."
msgstr ""
"如果你已安裝 GIMP、Krita 或 Photoshop 等影像編輯器，它們一般都能直接開啟圖"
"片，並另存為 WebP 格式。"

msgid ""
"Since WebP supports animations and the documentation can display videos, "
"GIFs should be avoided. Their compression is inefficient and they only "
"support a 256-color palette with 1-bit transparency."
msgstr ""
"由於 WebP 支援動畫，且文件頁面也能顯示影片，因此GIF不建議使用 。 GIF 的壓縮效"

msgid "Cropping"
msgstr "裁剪"

msgid ""
"For a screenshot of a 2D or 3D scene in the editor, the above steps will be "
"enough. But for most UI images some extra work should be done, specifically "
"cropping to make an image look clean. Below is an example of good cropping."
msgstr ""
"如果是編輯器中 2D 或 3D 場景的截圖，上述步驟已足夠。但對於大多數 UI 圖片，還"
"需要額外裁剪，讓畫面更乾淨。下方是良好裁剪的範例。"

msgid ""
"For cropping Krita is the recommended program. While some screenshot "
"programs do have cropping built-in it's not always easy to get something "
"precise. And while Krita is designed as a painting program the cropping tool "
"gives you pixel precision by default. Of course, feel free to use a "
"different program you are familiar with."
msgstr ""
"裁剪建議使用 Krita。部分截圖工具雖然內建裁剪功能，但不一定容易精確操作。"
"Krita 雖然以繪圖為主，但裁剪工具預設就能像素級操作。當然，你也可以用自己習慣"
"的其他軟體。"

msgid ""
"If you've never used Krita before download it from the `official Krita "
"website <https://krita.org/en/download/>`_, on Linux you may also be able to "

"useful for precision."
msgstr ""
"拖曳白色方框來調整裁剪範圍。如果放大圖片，可以精確對齊像素，這對精準裁剪很有"

"still selected and the controls will return."
msgstr ""
"若裁剪錯誤或過度裁剪也不用擔心，Krita 的裁剪是非破壞性的，可以隨時調整。選取"

msgid "Scaling down an image"
msgstr "縮小圖片"

msgid ""
"As explained earlier on this page, all images taken on a screen that is a "
"higher resolution than 1080p should be scaled down. To do this in Krita "
"click on **Image** on the top bar, and from the dropdown menu select **Scale "
"Image To New Size**. This menu can also be opened by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl + "
"Alt + I`. On this menu you want to adjust the pixel dimensions. For anything "
"taken on a 4K monitor change the value of the width and height to half of "
"its current value, for anything taken on a 1440p monitor multiply the width "
"and height by 0.75. Make sure the **Constrain Proportions** box at the "
"bottom of the menu is checked so you only have to change 1 value."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To save an image as webp if it isn't already one, Go to **File > Save As**. "
"Select **webp** from the **Save as type:** dropdown, then choose wherever "
"you want to save it. After clicking **Save** a menu will popup with webp "
"options. Make sure **Lossless** is checked and **Quality** is set to 100%. "
"This means the image will not lose detail and will be as small as possible."
msgstr ""
"如果圖片還不是 WebP 格式，請選擇 **檔案 > 另存新檔** ，在 **儲存類型：** 選單"
"選擇 **webp** ，選好儲存路徑後按 **儲存** 。接著會有一個 WebP 選項視窗，請勾"
"選 **Lossless** （無損）並將 **Quality** （品質）設為 100%。這樣可保證細節不"
"流失，檔案大小也最小化。"

msgid ""
"If the image is over 300KB in size try compressing it losslessly using "
"`Squoosh <https://squoosh.app/>`_. If it's still over 300KB change to lossy "
"compression and slowly increase the compression until it's under 300KB. If "

msgid "Outlines, arrows and text"
msgstr "輪廓、箭頭與文字"

msgid ""
"Sometimes an image needs something extra to properly direct the readers "
"attention, or make something clear. Outlines and arrows can be used for this "
"purpose. For these types of edits Inkscape is the recommended open source "
"program, it can be downloaded from the `official Inkscape website <https://"

msgid ""
"A full tutorial on creating outlines is not provided here, we recommend "
"searching for various tutorials on how to use it online. However there are "
"two standards for doc image outlines and arrows. First, the color should be "
"yellow, specifically this hex color: ``fffb44`` (``fffb44ff`` if there is a "
"transparency value like in Inkscape). This color was chosen specifically to "
"make sure color blind people do not have issues reading the documentation, "
"other colors can be used in addition to this yellow if multiple outlines on "
"an image are needed, red should be avoided. The second standard is that all "
"outlines and arrow lines should be 2 pixels wide."
msgstr ""
"這裡不提供詳細教學，建議可上網找相關教學。文件圖片的輪廓和箭頭有兩個標準：第"
"一，顏色要用黃色，色碼為 ``fffb44``（如 Inkscape 需透明度則為 "
"``fffb44ff``）。這是為確保色盲者也能辨識。若需多重標示，可搭配其他顏色，但避"
"免使用紅色。第二，所有輪廓和箭頭線寬都應為 2 像素。"

msgid ""
"Finally, some images might require text to differentiate multiple parts of "
"an image. There are no strict requirements other than use an easy to read "
"non fancy font. As for color the yellow color from before should also be "
"used, but black or other colors can be used if appropriate. For example, if "
"yellow blends into the image, or if there are multiple outlines in multiple "
"colors."
msgstr ""
"有些圖片可能還需要加文字來區分各部分。字型只要簡單易讀即可。顏色建議用前述黃"
"色，但如果不清楚，也可用黑色或其他合適顏色。例如，黃色和底圖混在一起時，或是"
"有多個不同顏色輪廓時。"

msgid "Adding an image to a documentation page"
