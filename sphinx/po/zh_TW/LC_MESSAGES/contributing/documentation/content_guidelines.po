"This document outlines what should be included in the official "
"documentation. Below, you will find a couple of principles and "
"recommendations for writing accessible content."
msgstr ""
"本文件說明官方說明文件應包含哪些內容。以下列出幾項原則與建議，幫助撰寫易於理"
"解的內容。"

msgid "We want to achieve two goals:"
msgstr "我們希望達成兩個目標："

msgid ""
"**Empathize with our users.** We should write in a way that makes it easy "
"for them to learn from the docs."
msgstr ""
"**設身處地為使用者著想。** 我們應以讓使用者能輕鬆從文件中學習的方式來撰寫內"
"容。"

msgid ""
"**Write a complete reference manual**. Our goal here is not to teach "
"programming fundamentals. Instead, our goal is to provide a reference for "
"how Godot's features work."
msgstr ""
"**編寫完整的參考手冊** 。 我們的目標不是教授程式設計基礎，而是提供 Godot 功能"
"運作方式的參考資料。"

msgid "Guidelines and principles"
msgstr "指引與原則"

msgid ""
"Below are the guidelines we should strive to follow. They are not hard "
"rules, though: sometimes, a topic will require breaking one or more of them. "
"Still, we should strive to achieve the two goals listed above."
msgstr ""
"下列是我們應盡量遵循的指引。這些不是硬性規定：有時某些主題需要打破其中一項或"
"多項。不過我們仍應以達成上述兩個目標為優先。"

msgid "Writing complete and accessible documentation"
msgstr "撰寫完整且易於理解的說明文件"

msgid ""
"**A feature doesn't exist unless it is documented**. If a user can't find "
"information about a feature and how it works, it doesn't exist to them. We "
"should ensure that we cover everything Godot does."
msgstr ""
"**沒有文件就等於沒有這個功能** 。如果使用者找不到某功能的說明與用法，這項功能"
"對他們來說就不存在。我們應該確保所有 Godot 功能皆有覆蓋。"

msgid ""
"When adding or updating an engine feature, the documentation team needs to "
"know about it. Contributors should open an issue on the `godot-docs` "
"repository when their work gets merged and requires documentation."
msgstr ""
"新增或更新引擎功能時，說明文件團隊需要得知相關資訊。當你的貢獻被合併且需要文"
"件時，請在 `godot-docs` 儲存庫建立 Issue。"

msgid ""
"Do your best to keep documents **under 1000 words in length**. If a page "
"goes past that threshold, consider splitting it into two parts. Limiting "
"page size forces us to write concisely and to break up large documents so "
"that each page focuses on a particular problem."
msgstr ""
"請盡量讓說明文件**維持在 1000 個單詞以內**。若頁面超過這個上限，請考慮拆分成"
"多個部分。限制頁面長度可促使我們精簡寫作，並將大型文件拆解，讓每頁專注於單一"
"問題。"

msgid ""
"Each page or section of a page should clearly state what **problem** it "
"tackles and what it will teach the user. Users need to know if they're "
"reading the correct guide for solving the problems they're encountering. For "
"example, instead of writing the heading \"Signals\", consider writing "
"\"Reacting to changes with signals\". The second title makes it clear what "
"the purpose of signals is."
msgstr ""
"每個頁面或章節都應明確說明**要解決的問題**以及能讓使用者學到什麼。使用者需了"
"解他們是否正在閱讀能解決自身問題的正確指引。例如，標題請不要只寫「訊號"
"（Signals）」，建議寫成「使用訊號回應變化」。後者更能明確表達訊號的目的。"

msgid ""
"Long section titles lead to long entries in the side menu, which can make "
"navigation cumbersome. Try to keep headings five words long or less."
msgstr ""
"章節標題過長會讓側邊選單變得冗長，導覽也不便。請盡量將標題控制在五個單詞以"
"內。"

msgid ""
"If the page assumes specific knowledge of other Godot features, mention it "
"and link to the corresponding documentation. For instance, a page about "
"physics may use signals, in which case you could note that the signals "
"tutorial is a prerequisite. You may also link to other websites for "
"prerequisites beyond the documentation's scope. For example, you could link "
"to an introduction to programming in the getting started guide, or a website "
"that teaches math theory in the math section."
msgstr ""
"若頁面假設讀者已瞭解其他 Godot 功能，請註明並連結至相關文件。舉例來說，若物理"
"相關章節用到訊號，請標註「訊號教學」為先備知識。若先備知識超出本說明文件範"
"圍，也可連結外部網站。例如於入門指引連結「程式設計簡介」，或於數學章節連結數"
"學理論教學網站。"

msgid "Limiting cognitive load"
msgstr "減輕認知負擔"

msgid ""
"Limit the cognitive load required to read the documentation. The simpler and "
"more explicit language we use, the more efficient it becomes for people to "
"learn. You can do so by:"
msgstr ""
"降低閱讀說明文件時的認知負擔。語言越簡單明確，學習效率就越高。你可以透過以下"
"方式達成："

msgid "Introducing only one new concept at a time whenever possible."
msgstr "盡可能每次只介紹一個新概念。"

msgid "Using simple English, as we recommend in our writing guidelines."
msgstr "請如我們寫作指引中所建議，使用簡潔易懂的英文。"

msgid ""
"Including one or more **concrete usage examples**. Prefer a real-world "
"example to one that uses names like ``foo``, ``bar``, or ``baz``."
msgstr ""
"請提供一個或多個**具體的實際應用範例**。真實案例遠比使用 ``foo``、``bar``、"
"``baz`` 這類抽象變數名稱來得好。"

msgid ""
"While many people may understand more complex language and abstract "
"examples, you will lose others. Understandable writing and practical "
"examples benefit everyone."
msgstr ""
"雖然有些人能理解較複雜的語言或抽象範例，但你也可能因此失去其他讀者。通俗易懂"
"的寫作與實用範例對所有人都有幫助。"

msgid ""
"Always make an effort to **put yourself in the user's shoes**. When we "
"understand something thoroughly, it becomes obvious to us. We may fail to "
"think about details relevant to a newcomer, but **good documentation meets "
"users where they are**. We should explain each feature's capabilities or "
"intended uses with the most straightforward language possible."
msgstr ""
"務必**設想自己是使用者**。當我們對某事物已非常熟悉時，很多細節就會變得理所當"
"然，但有些新手未必能理解。**優良的說明文件應該從使用者角度出發**，並以最直白"
"的語言說明每個功能的用途與適用情境。"

msgid ""
"Try to remember what you first needed to know when learning about the "
"feature or concept. What new terms did you need to learn? What confused you? "
"What was the hardest to grasp? You will want users to review your work, and "
"we recommend you practice explaining the feature before writing about it."
msgstr ""
"請回想你初次學習某個功能或概念時，最需要先瞭解什麼？有沒有遇到不懂的術語？哪"
"裡讓你困惑？又是哪些地方最難掌握？你會希望有其他使用者檢閱你的內容。我們建議"
"你在動筆前，先練習口頭解釋這個功能。"

msgid ""
"Programming fundamentals are a prerequisite for using a complex engine like "
"Godot. Talking about variables, functions, or classes is acceptable. But we "
"should favor plain language over specific terminology like "
"\"metaprogramming\". If you need to use precise terms, be sure to define "
"them."
msgstr ""
"具備程式設計基礎是使用 Godot 這類複雜引擎的前提。討論變數、函式、類別等是可以"
"的，但比起「元程式設計」這類專有術語，更應優先使用平實的語言。如果必須用到嚴"
"格定義的術語，請務必給予解釋。"
