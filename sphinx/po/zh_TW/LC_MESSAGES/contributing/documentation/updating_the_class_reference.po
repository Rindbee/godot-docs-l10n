msgid ""
"The :ref:`Class reference <doc_class_reference>` is a set of articles "
"describing the public API of the engine. This includes descriptions for "
"various classes, methods, properties, and global objects, available for "
"scripting. The class reference is available online, from the documentation "
"sidebar, and in the Godot editor, from the help menu."
msgstr ""
":ref:`類別參考 <doc_class_reference>` 是一系列說明引擎公開 API 的文章。內容涵"
"蓋各類別、方法、屬性與全域物件的詳細說明，供腳本撰寫時使用。類別參考可於官方"
"線上文件、側邊欄與 Godot 編輯器的說明選單中查閱。"

msgid ""
"As the engine grows and features are added or modified, some parts of the "
"class reference become obsolete and new descriptions and examples need to be "
"added. While developers are required to document their work in the class "
"reference when submitting a pull request, we can't expect every programmer "
"to be a good technical writer. There is always work for contributors like "
"you to polish existing and create missing reference material."
msgstr ""
"隨著引擎持續成長、功能增加或調整，類別參考的部分內容可能會過時，因此需要補充"
"新的說明與範例。雖然開發者上傳 Pull Request 時需同步撰寫類別參考，但不是每位"
"程式設計師都擅長技術寫作。因此，非常需要像你這樣的貢獻者協助補足與優化現有或"
"缺漏的參考內容。"

msgid "The source of the class reference"
msgstr "類別參考的來源"

msgid ""
"As the class reference is available in two places, online and in the editor, "
"we need to take care to keep things in sync. To achieve this the `main Godot "
"repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/>`_ is picked as the source "
"of truth, and the documentation for the class reference is tracked there."
msgstr ""
"由於類別參考同時提供於線上文件與 Godot 編輯器中，必須注意兩者內容同步。因此，"
"`Godot 主儲存庫 <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/>`_ 被視為唯一正本，所"
"有類別參考文件皆以此為依據並在該處維護。"

msgid ""
"You should **not** edit ``.rst`` files in the ``classes/`` folder of the "
"`documentation repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/>`_. "
"These files are generated automatically and are synced manually by project "
"maintainers. Read further to learn how to correctly edit the class reference."
msgstr ""
"你**不應該**編輯 `文件儲存庫 <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/>`_ "
"的 ``classes/`` 資料夾裡的 ``.rst`` 檔。這些檔案是自動產生的，由專案維護者手"
"動同步。請繼續閱讀以了解正確編輯類別參考的方法。"

msgid ""
"In the main repository the class reference is stored in XML files, one for "
"each exposed class or global object. The majority of these files is located "
"in `doc/classes/ <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/doc/"
"classes>`_, but some modules contain their own documentation as well. You "
"will find it in the ``modules/<module_name>/doc_classes/`` directory. To "
"learn more about editing XML files refer "
"to :ref:`doc_class_reference_primer`."
msgstr ""
"在主儲存庫中，類別參考以 XML 檔案形式儲存，每個公開的類別或全域物件各有一份。"
"大部分檔案位於 `doc/classes/ <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/"
"master/doc/classes>`_，但部分模組也有自己的文件，這些會在 ``modules/"

"**Important:** If you plan to make large changes, you should create an issue "

msgid "What to contribute"
msgstr "可參與的內容"

msgid ""
"The natural place to start contributing is the classes that you are most "
"familiar with. This ensures that the added description will be based on "
"experience and the necessary know-how, not just the name of a method or a "
"property. We advise not to add low effort descriptions, no matter how "
"appealing it may look. Such descriptions obscure the need for documentation "
"and are hard to identify automatically."
msgstr ""
"最適合開始貢獻的內容，就是你最熟悉的類別。這能確保所新增的說明基於實務經驗與"
"相關知識，而不只是方法或屬性的名稱。我們建議不要添加簡略或敷衍的描述，即使這"
"樣做看來很方便。類似內容會掩蓋實際的文件需求，也不易被自動偵測出來。"

msgid ""
"Following this principle is important and allows us to create tools for "
"contributors. Such as the class reference's `completion status tracker "
"<https://godotengine.github.io/doc-status/>`_. You can use it to quickly "
"find documentation pages missing descriptions."
msgstr ""
"遵循這個原則非常重要，這也讓我們能開發出各類輔助工具協助貢獻者，例如類別參考"
"的 `完成度追蹤器 <https://godotengine.github.io/doc-status/>`_。你可以用它快"
"速找出哪些文件頁面缺少說明。"

msgid ""
"If you decide to document a class, but don't know what a particular method "
"does, don't worry. Leave it for now, and list the methods you skipped when "
"you open a pull request with your changes. Another writer will take care of "
"it."
msgstr ""
"若你決定補充某個類別文件，但對其中部分方法不了解，沒關係，可以先略過。請於送"
"出 Pull Request 時，列出所有你暫時未補充說明的方法，其他編寫者會協助補齊。"

msgid ""
"Unless you make minor changes, like fixing a typo, we do not recommend using "
"the GitHub web editor to edit the class reference's XML files. It lacks "
"features to edit XML well, like keeping indentations consistent, and it does "
"not allow amending commits based on reviews."
msgstr ""
"除非僅需進行微幅修改（例如更正錯字），否則不建議直接用 GitHub 網頁編輯器修改"
"類別參考的 XML 檔案。該編輯器缺乏良好的 XML 編輯功能（例如自動縮排），也無法"
"根據審查意見修正 Commit。"

msgid ""
"It also doesn't allow you to test your changes in the engine or with "
"validation scripts as described in :ref:`doc_class_reference_editing_xml`."
msgstr ""
"此外你也無法如 :ref:`doc_class_reference_editing_xml` 所述，在引擎內或透過驗"
"證腳本測試你的變更。"

msgid "Updating class reference when working on the engine"
msgstr "於引擎開發時更新類別參考"

msgid ""
"When you create a new class or modify an existing engine's API, you need to "
"re-generate the XML files in ``doc/classes/``."
msgstr ""
"當你新增類別或修改現有引擎的 API 時，需要重新產生 ``doc/classes/`` 內的 XML "
"檔案。"

msgid ""
"To do so, you first need to compile Godot. See "
"the :ref:`doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem` page to learn how. Then, "
"execute the compiled Godot binary from the Godot root directory with the ``--"
"doctool`` option. For example, if you're on 64-bit Linux, the command might "

"The exact set of suffixes may be different. Carefully read through the "
"linked article to learn more about that."
msgstr "實際的檔案後綴可能有所不同，請詳閱文中連結以瞭解細節。"

"The XML files in ``doc/classes/`` should then be up-to-date with current "
"Godot Engine features. You can then check what changed using the ``git "
"diff`` command."
msgstr ""
"此時，``doc/classes/`` 內的 XML 檔案應該已同步至最新的 Godot Engine 功能。你"
"可透過 ``git diff`` 指令檢查變更內容。"

msgid ""
"Please only include changes that are relevant to your work on the API in "
"your commits. You can discard changes in other XML files using ``git "
"checkout``, but consider reporting if you notice unrelated files being "
"updated. Ideally, running this command should only bring up the changes that "
"you yourself have made."
msgstr ""
"請僅將和你 API 相關的變更一併提交。如有不相關的檔案被修改，可用 ``git "
"checkout`` 取消。若發現有無關檔案被更新，也可以考慮回報。理想情況下，這些動作"
"應只產生你自己做的變更。"

msgid "You will then need to add descriptions to any newly generated entries."
msgstr "接著，你需要為所有新產生的項目補上說明內容。"
