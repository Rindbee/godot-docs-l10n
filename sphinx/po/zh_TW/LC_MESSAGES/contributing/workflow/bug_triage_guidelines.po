"*Confirmed*: has been confirmed by at least one other contributor than the "
"bug reporter (typically for *Bug* reports). The purpose of this label is to "
"let developers know which issues are still reproducible when they want to "
"select what to work on. It is therefore a good practice to add in a comment "
