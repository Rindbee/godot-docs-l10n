msgid "Contributing code changes upstream has two big advantages:"
msgstr "向上游貢獻程式碼修改有兩大好處："

msgid ""
"Your own code will be reviewed and improved by other developers, and will be "
"further maintained directly in the upstream project, so you won't have to "
"reapply your own changes every time you move to a newer version. On the "
"other hand it comes with a responsibility, as your changes have to be "
"generic enough to be beneficial to all users, and not just your project; so "
"in some cases it might still be relevant to keep your changes only for your "
"own project, if they are too specific."
msgstr ""
"你的程式碼會由其他開發者審查並改進，並直接在上游專案維護，因此每次升級到新版"
"時不必再次套用自己的修改。另一方面，這也代表你的修改需要夠通用，能讓所有使用"
"者受益，而不只是你自己的專案；如果你的變更過於專案導向，則仍建議只保留在自己"
"的專案內。"

msgid ""
"The whole community will benefit from your work, and other contributors will "
"behave the same way, contributing code that will be beneficial to you. At "
"the time of this writing, over 2,000 developers have contributed code "
"changes to the engine!"
msgstr ""
"整個社群都會因為你的貢獻而受益，而其他貢獻者也會用同樣的方式回饋，提供對你有"
"幫助的程式碼。撰寫本文時，已有超過 2,000 位開發者為引擎貢獻了程式碼！"

"To ensure good collaboration and overall quality, the Godot developers "
"enforce some rules for code contributions, for example regarding the style "
"to use in the C++ code (indentation, brackets, etc.) or the Git and PR "
"workflow."
msgstr ""
"為了確保良好的協作與程式碼品質，Godot 開發團隊對程式碼貢獻訂有一些規範，例如 "
"C++ 程式碼風格（縮排、括號等）以及 Git 與 PR 的工作流程。"

"A good place to start is by searching for issues tagged as `good first issue "

"All pull requests must go through a review process before being accepted. "
"Depending on the scope of the changes, it may take some time for a "
"maintainer responsible for the modified part of the engine to provide their "
"review. We value all of our contributors and ask them to be patient in the "
"meantime, as it is expected that in an open source project like Godot, there "
"is going to be way more contributions than people validating them."
msgstr ""
"所有 Pull Request 在被接受前都必須經過審查流程。根據修改的範圍，負責該部分的"
"維護者可能需要一些時間進行審查。我們非常重視每一位貢獻者，也請大家耐心等待，"
"因為在像 Godot 這樣的開源專案中，通常貢獻數量會遠超過審查人力。"

"To make sure that your time and efforts aren't wasted, it is recommended to "
"vet the idea first before implementing it and putting it for a review as a "
"PR. To that end, Godot has a `proposal system <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot-proposals>`_. Its usage is encouraged to plan changes and "

msgstr ""
"為避免浪費你的時間與精力，建議在實作並提出 PR 之前，先討論與評估你的想法。為"

msgid "Testing and reporting issues"

msgid ""
"Another great way of contributing to the engine is to test development "
"releases or the development branch and to report issues. It is also helpful "
"to report issues discovered in stable releases, so that they can be fixed in "
"the development branch and in future maintenance releases."
msgstr ""
"另一個貢獻引擎的好方式是測試開發版或開發分支，並回報問題。若能回報在穩定版發"

msgid ""
"Test \"trusted\" unofficial builds of the development branch; just ask "

"use official binaries or to compile yourself though, to be sure about the "
"provenance of your binaries."
msgstr ""
"也可測試開發分支的「可信賴」非官方版本；可向社群成員詢問可靠的來源。不過，建"

msgid ""
"As mentioned previously, it is also helpful to keep your eyes peeled for "
"potential bugs that might still be present in the stable releases, "
"especially when using some niche features of the engine which might get less "
"testing by the developers."
