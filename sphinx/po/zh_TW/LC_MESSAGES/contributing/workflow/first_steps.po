"Your own code will be reviewed and improved by other developers, and will be "

"reapply your own changes every time you move to a newer version. On the "
"other hand it comes with a responsibility, as your changes have to be "
"generic enough to be beneficial to all users, and not just your project; so "
"in some cases it might still be relevant to keep your changes only for your "
"own project, if they are too specific."

"所撰寫的程式碼會經過其他開發者的審閱與改進，接著會進一步直接在上游專案中被維"
"護，因此接下來每次更新到新版本後就不需要再重新套用這些修改。另一方面，由於這"
"個改動不能只對你自己的專案有利而已，還必須要讓一般的使用者都能從中獲益，因此"
"這也是一種責任。所以，如果這些改動只適用於你的專案的話，則這些情況就應該只將"
