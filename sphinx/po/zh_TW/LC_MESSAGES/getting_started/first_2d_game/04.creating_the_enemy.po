"the screen, choose a random direction, and move in a straight line."
msgstr ""
"是時候來做一些讓玩家閃躲的敵人了。這些敵人的行為不會很複雜：怪物會隨機在螢幕"

msgstr "別忘了把子節點設定成無法選擇，跟剛剛在 Player 場景中一樣。"

msgid ""
"Set up the :ref:`AnimatedSprite2D <class_AnimatedSprite2D>` like you did for "

"``walk``. There are two images for each animation in the art folder."
msgstr ""
"接著像剛才設定玩家那樣，設定 :ref:`AnimatedSprite <class_AnimatedSprite>` 。"

msgid ""
"We then need to pick a random number between ``0`` and ``2`` to select one "

"隨機選擇一個整數。"

msgid ""

"``VisibleOnScreenNotifier2D`` node to the ``Mob`` and add this code:"
msgstr ""
