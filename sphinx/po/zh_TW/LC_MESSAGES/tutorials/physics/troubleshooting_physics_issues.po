msgstr ""
"這種現象稱為 *穿隧（Tunneling）*。在 RigidBody 屬性中啟用 **連續碰撞檢測"

"thicker than the floor's visual representation."
msgstr ""
"將靜態碰撞形狀做得更厚。例如，如果你的地板很薄，導致玩家有機會穿越下方，可以"
"讓碰撞體比地板的實際外觀還厚。"

msgid ""
"Modify your fast-moving object's collision shape depending on its movement "
"speed. The faster the object moves, the larger the collision shape should "
"extend outside of the object to ensure it can collide with thin walls more "
"reliably."
msgstr ""
"依據物體的移動速度調整碰撞形狀。物體移動越快，碰撞形狀就應該往外延伸得越多，"

msgid "Stacked objects are unstable and wobbly"
msgstr "堆疊的物件不穩定且晃動"

msgid ""
"Despite seeming like a simple problem, stable RigidBody simulation with "
"stacked objects is difficult to implement in a physics engine. This is "
"caused by integrating forces going against each other. The more stacked "
"objects are present, the stronger the forces will be against each other. "
"This eventually causes the simulation to become wobbly, making the objects "
"unable to rest on top of each other without moving."
msgstr ""
"雖然看似簡單，但在物理引擎中實現堆疊剛體的穩定模擬其實很困難。這是因為多個力"
"彼此交互作用造成的，堆疊物件越多，相互作用的力就越強，最後會導致模擬不穩定，"
"使物件無法安穩地彼此堆疊、靜止不動。"

"Increasing the physics simulation rate can help alleviate this issue. To do "
"so, increase :ref:`Physics Ticks per "

msgid "Scaled physics bodies or collision shapes do not collide correctly"
msgstr "縮放後的物理物件或碰撞形狀碰撞異常"

msgid ""
"Godot does not currently support scaling of physics bodies or collision "
"shapes. As a workaround, change the collision shape's extents instead of "
"changing its scale. If you want the visual representation's scale to change "
"as well, change the scale of the underlying visual representation (Sprite2D, "
"MeshInstance3D, …) and change the collision shape's extents separately. Make "
"sure the collision shape is not a child of the visual representation in this "
"case."
msgstr ""
"Godot 目前尚未支援直接縮放物理物件或碰撞形狀。建議改變碰撞形狀的範圍"
"（extents）而非縮放比例。如果你要連視覺外觀（如 Sprite2D、MeshInstance3D 等）"
"一起縮放，請分別調整視覺外觀的縮放比例與碰撞形狀的範圍。此時請確保碰撞形狀不"
"是視覺物件的子節點。"

msgid ""
"Since resources are shared by default, you'll have to make the collision "
"shape resource unique if you don't want the change to be applied to all "
"nodes using the same collision shape resource in the scene. This can be done "
"by calling ``duplicate()`` in a script on the collision shape resource "
"*before* changing its size."
msgstr ""
"由於預設情況下資源為共用，若你不希望修改影響到場景中所有使用同一個碰撞形狀資"

msgstr "地板的碰撞形狀太薄。"

msgid "The RigidBody's collision shape is too thin."
msgstr "剛體（RigidBody）的碰撞形狀太薄。"

msgid ""
"In the first case, this can be alleviated by making the floor's collision "
"shape thicker. For example, if you have a thin floor that the player can't "
"get below in some way, you can make the collider thicker than the floor's "

msgstr ""
"若屬於第一種情況，可以將地板的碰撞形狀做得更厚。例如，若地板很薄、玩家卻不能"
"穿過，可以讓碰撞體比地板的外觀還厚。"

msgid ""
"In the second case, this can usually only be resolved by increasing the "
"physics simulation rate (as making the shape thicker would cause a "
"disconnect between the RigidBody's visual representation and its collision)."
msgstr ""
"第二種情況下，通常只能透過提升物理模擬速率來解決（因為厚化形狀會導致剛體的視"
"覺外觀與碰撞不一致）。"

msgid ""
"In both cases, increasing the physics simulation rate can also help "
"alleviate this issue. To do so, increase :ref:`Physics Ticks per "

msgid ""
"During the transition from Bullet to GodotPhysics in Godot 4, cylinder "
"collision shapes had to be reimplemented from scratch. However, cylinder "
"collision shapes are one of the most difficult shapes to support, which is "
"why many other physics engines don't provide any support for them. There are "
"several known bugs with cylinder collision shapes currently."
msgstr ""
"Godot 4 從 Bullet 過渡到 GodotPhysics 時，圓柱體碰撞形狀必須重新實作。然而，"
"圓柱體是支援難度最高的碰撞形狀之一，因此許多其他物理引擎也不支援。目前圓柱體"
"碰撞形狀仍有若干已知錯誤。"

msgid ""
"If you are sticking to GodotPhysics, we recommend using box or capsule "
"collision shapes for characters for now. Boxes generally provide the best "
"reliability, but have the downside of making the character take more space "
"diagonally. Capsule collision shapes do not have this downside, but their "
"shape can make precision platforming more difficult."
msgstr ""
"若你仍然使用 GodotPhysics，目前建議角色使用盒狀或膠囊狀的碰撞形狀。盒狀通常最"
"可靠，但會讓角色在斜向上占用較多空間。膠囊狀沒有這個缺點，但其形狀可能讓精準"
"的平台跳躍更難掌控。"

msgid "VehicleBody simulation is unstable, especially at high speeds"
msgstr "VehicleBody 模擬不穩定，特別在高速下更明顯"

msgid ""
"When a physics body moves at a high speed, it travels a large distance "
"between each physics step. For instance, when using the 1 unit = 1 meter "
"convention in 3D, a vehicle moving at 360 km/h will travel 100 units per "
"second. With the default physics simulation rate of 60 Hz, the vehicle moves "
"by ~1.67 units each physics tick. This means that small objects may be "
"ignored entirely by the vehicle (due to tunneling), but also that the "
"simulation has little data to work with in general at such a high speed."
msgstr ""
"當物理物件高速移動時，每個物理步驟之間會移動很長距離。例如，3D 場景採用 1 單"
"位 = 1 公尺，當車輛以 360 公里/小時行駛時，每秒會移動 100 單位。若物理模擬速"
"率為預設 60 Hz，車輛每個物理刻度會移動約 1.67 單位。這代表車輛可能會完全忽略"
"小型物件（因為穿隧效應），而且在高速時模擬可用的資料也很少。"

msgid ""
"Fast-moving vehicles can benefit a lot from an increased physics simulation "
"rate. To do so, increase :ref:`Physics Ticks per "

msgid "Collision results in bumps when an object moves across tiles"
msgstr "物件橫越瓷磚（Tile）時，碰撞造成顛簸"

msgid ""
"This is a known issue in the physics engine caused by the object bumping on "
"a shape's edges, even though that edge is covered by another shape. This can "
"occur in both 2D and 3D."
msgstr ""
"這是物理引擎的已知問題，物件在移動時會碰到碰撞形狀的邊緣，即使該邊緣已被另一"
"個形狀覆蓋。此問題在 2D 與 3D 場景都可能發生。"

msgid ""
"The best way to work around this issue is to create a \"composite\" "
"collider. This means that instead of individual tiles having their "
"collision, you create a single collision shape representing the collision "
"for a group of tiles. Typically, you should split composite colliders on a "
"per-island basis (which means each group of touching tiles gets its own "
"collider)."
msgstr ""
"最佳的解決方式是製作「複合碰撞體」。也就是說，不要讓每個瓷磚（Tile）都有自己"
"獨立的碰撞形狀，而是為一組相連的瓷磚建立單一的碰撞形狀。通常建議以區塊（每組"
"連在一起的瓷磚）為單位切分複合碰撞體。"

msgid ""
"Using a composite collider can also improve physics simulation performance "
"in certain cases. However, since the composite collision shape is much more "
"complex, this may not be a net performance win in all cases."
msgstr ""
"有時候使用複合碰撞體也能提升物理模擬效能。但因為複合碰撞形狀本身也可能變得很"
"複雜，不見得所有情境下都能提昇效能。"

msgid ""
"In Godot 4.5 and later, creating a composite collider is automatically done "
"when using a TileMapLayer node. The chunk size (``16`` tiles on each axis by "
"default) can be set using the **Physics Quadrant Size** property in the "
"TileMapLayer inspector. Larger values provide more reliable collision, at "
"the cost of slower updates when the TileMap is changed."
msgstr ""
"在 Godot 4.5 之後，使用 TileMapLayer 節點時會自動建立複合碰撞體。分塊大小（預"
"設每軸 ``16`` 個圖塊）可在 TileMapLayer 的檢視器中透過 **Physics Quadrant "
"Size** 屬性設定。數值越大，碰撞越可靠，但在變更 TileMap 時更新會較慢。"

msgid "Framerate drops when an object touches another object"
msgstr "物件互相接觸時畫面更新率下降"

msgid ""
"This is likely due to one of the objects using a collision shape that is too "
"complex. Convex collision shapes should use a number of shapes as low as "
"possible for performance reasons. When relying on Godot's automatic "
"generation, it's possible that you ended up with dozens if not hundreds of "
"shapes created for a single convex shape collision resource."
msgstr ""
"這通常是因為某個物件使用了過於複雜的碰撞形狀。為了效能考量，凸形（Convex）碰"
"撞體應盡量減少構成形狀的數量。若你用 Godot 自動產生碰撞形狀，可能會為單一碰撞"
"資源產生數十甚至上百個形狀，造成效能下滑。"

msgid ""
"In some cases, replacing a convex collider with a couple of primitive "
"collision shapes (box, sphere, or capsule) can deliver better performance."
msgstr ""
"有時候用幾個簡單的基本碰撞形狀（如盒型、球型或膠囊型）取代原本的凸形碰撞體，"
"可以大幅提升效能。"

msgid ""
"This issue can also occur with StaticBodies that use very detailed trimesh "
"(concave) collisions. In this case, use a simplified representation of the "
"level geometry as a collider. Not only this will improve physics simulation "
"performance significantly, but this can also improve stability by letting "
"you remove small fixtures and crevices from being considered by collision."
msgstr ""
"這個問題也可能發生在使用高細節三角網格（trimesh，凹面）碰撞的靜態物件"
"（StaticBody）上。此時建議用簡化後的關卡幾何模型來做碰撞體，這不只大幅提升物"
"理效能，還能排除小型突出物或縫隙，讓碰撞更穩定。"

msgid ""
"In 3D, switching the physics engine from the default GodotPhysics to Jolt "
"can also improve performance. See :ref:`doc_using_jolt_physics` for more "
"information."
msgstr ""
"在 3D 中，將物理引擎從預設的 GodotPhysics 切換為 Jolt 也能提升效能。詳情請"
"見 :ref:`doc_using_jolt_physics`。"

msgid ""
"Framerate suddenly drops to a very low value beyond a certain amount of "
"physics simulation"
msgstr "物理模擬數量超過某個門檻時幀率驟降"

msgid ""
"This occurs because the physics engine can't keep up with the expected "
"simulation rate. In this case, the framerate will start dropping, but the "
"engine is only allowed to simulate a certain number of physics steps per "
"rendered frame. This snowballs into a situation where framerate keeps "
"dropping until it reaches a very low framerate (typically 1-2 FPS) and is "
"called the *physics spiral of death*."
msgstr ""
"這是因為物理引擎無法跟上預期的模擬速率。一旦出現這種情況，畫面更新率會開始下"
"滑，但引擎每幀允許的物理步驟有限，這會造成惡性循環，幀率愈降愈低，最後只剩下 "
"1-2 FPS，這種現象稱為 *物理死亡螺旋*。"

msgid ""
"To avoid this, you should check for situations in your project that can "
"cause excessive number of physics simulations to occur at the same time (or "
"with excessively complex collision shapes). If these situations cannot be "
"avoided, you can increase the **Max Physics Steps per Frame** project "
"setting and/or reduce **Physics Ticks per Second** to alleviate this."
msgstr ""
"為避免這種情況，請檢查專案是否有同時觸發大量物理模擬，或有過於複雜的碰撞形"
"狀。若無法避免，可提高 **每幀最大物理步數（Max Physics Steps per Frame）**，"
"並/或降低 **每秒物理更新次數（Physics Ticks per Second）** 來緩解。"

msgid "Physics simulation is unreliable when far away from the world origin"
msgstr "物理模擬距離世界原點太遠時會變得不可靠"

msgid ""
"This is caused by floating-point precision errors, which become more "
"pronounced as the physics simulation occurs further away from the world "
"origin. This issue also affects rendering, which results in wobbly camera "
"movement when far away from the world origin. "
"See :ref:`doc_large_world_coordinates` for more information."
msgstr ""
"這是因為浮點數精度誤差，當物理模擬發生在距離世界原點很遠的地方時，誤差會加"
"劇。這也會影響畫面渲染，例如相機畫面晃動。請參"
"閱 :ref:`doc_large_world_coordinates` 以瞭解更多資訊。"
