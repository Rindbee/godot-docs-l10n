msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Since version 3.1, Godot supports ragdoll physics. Ragdolls rely on physics "
"simulation to create realistic procedural animation. They are used for death "
"animations in many games."
msgstr ""
"自 3.1 版起，Godot 支援布娃娃物理。布娃娃利用物理模擬來產生寫實的程式化動畫，"
"常見於許多遊戲的死亡動畫。"

msgid ""
"In this tutorial, we will be using the Platformer3D demo to set up a ragdoll."
msgstr "本教學將以 Platformer3D 範例專案來設定布娃娃。"

msgid ""
"You can download the Platformer3D demo on `GitHub <https://github.com/"
"godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/3d/platformer>`_ or using the "
"`Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2748>`_."

"你可以在 `GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/"

"godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2748>`_ 取得。"

msgid "Setting up the ragdoll"
msgstr "設定布娃娃"

msgid "Creating physical bones"
msgstr "建立物理骨骼"

msgid ""
"Like many other features in the engine, there is a node to set up a ragdoll: "
"the :ref:`PhysicalBone3D <class_PhysicalBone3D>` node. To simplify the "
"setup, you can generate ``PhysicalBone`` nodes with the \"Create physical "
"skeleton\" feature in the skeleton node."
msgstr ""
"就像引擎裡的許多功能一樣，Godot 也有專門用來設定布娃娃的節"
"點：:ref:`PhysicalBone3D <class_PhysicalBone3D>`。為了簡化流程，可以直接在骨"
"架（Skeleton）節點裡利用「建立物理骨架」功能，快速產生 ``PhysicalBone`` 節"
"點。"

msgid ""
"Open the platformer demo in Godot, and then the Robi scene. Select the "
"``Skeleton`` node. A skeleton button appears on the top bar menu:"
msgstr ""
"在 Godot 中打開 Platformer3D 範例，然後打開 Robi 場景。選取 ``Skeleton`` 節"
"點。此時在上方工具列會出現骨架圖示："

msgid ""
"Click it and select the ``Create physical skeleton`` option. Godot will "
"generate ``PhysicalBone`` nodes and collision shapes for each bone in the "
"skeleton and pin joints to connect them together:"
msgstr ""
"點擊該圖示並選擇「建立物理骨架」選項。Godot 會自動為每個骨骼產生 "
"``PhysicalBone`` 節點與對應的碰撞形狀，並以釘住關節（Pin Joint）將它們串連起"
"來："

msgid ""
"Some of the generated bones aren't necessary: the ``MASTER`` bone for "
"example. So we're going to clean up the skeleton by removing them."
msgstr ""
"有些自動產生的骨骼其實不需要，例如 ``MASTER`` 骨骼。因此我們要清理骨架，把這"
"些多餘的骨骼刪除。"

msgid "Cleaning up the skeleton"
msgstr "清理骨架"

msgid ""
"Each ``PhysicalBone`` the engine needs to simulate has a performance cost, "
"so you want to remove every bone that is too small to make a difference in "
"the simulation, as well as all utility bones."
msgstr ""
"每一個需要模擬的 ``PhysicalBone`` 都會增加運算負擔，所以應該移除太小、對模擬"
"影響不大的骨骼，以及所有輔助用的骨骼。"

msgid ""
"For example, if we take a humanoid, you do not want to have physical bones "
"for each finger. You can use a single bone for the entire hand instead, or "
"one for the palm, one for the thumb, and a last one for the other four "
"fingers."
msgstr ""
"舉例來說，以人形角色為例，不建議每根手指都設物理骨骼。通常會以一根骨骼代表整"
"隻手，或是分成手掌、拇指與其他四指各用一根。"

msgid ""
"Remove these physical bones: ``MASTER``, ``waist``, ``neck``, "
"``headtracker``. This gives us an optimized skeleton and makes it easier to "
"control the ragdoll."
msgstr ""
"請刪除這些物理骨骼：``MASTER``、``waist``、``neck``、``headtracker``。這樣骨"
"架更精簡，也更容易控制布娃娃。"

msgid "Collision shape adjustment"
msgstr "調整碰撞形狀"

msgid ""
"The next task is adjusting the collision shape and the size of physical "
"bones to match the part of the body that each bone should simulate."
msgstr ""
"接下來，要將每個物理骨骼的碰撞形狀與尺寸調整成符合對應身體部位的大小與外型。"

msgid "Joints adjustment"
msgstr "調整關節"

msgid ""
"Once you adjusted the collision shapes, your ragdoll is almost ready. You "
"just want to adjust the pin joints to get a better simulation. "
"``PhysicalBone`` nodes have an unconstrained pin joint assigned to them by "
"default. To change the pin joint, select the ``PhysicalBone`` and change the "
"constraint type in the ``Joint`` section. There, you can change the "
"constraint's orientation and its limits."
msgstr ""
"碰撞形狀調整完成後，布娃娃就只差最後一步：調整釘住關節（Pin Joint）來獲得更寫"
"實的模擬效果。``PhysicalBone`` 預設會自帶一個無約束的釘住關節。若要修改關節，"
"請選取對應的 ``PhysicalBone``，在「Joint」區段調整約束型態、方向或限制。"

msgid "This is the final result:"
msgstr "成果應如下圖所示："

msgid "Simulating the ragdoll"
msgstr "布娃娃模擬"

msgid ""
"The ragdoll is now ready to use. To start the simulation and play the "
"ragdoll animation, you need to call the ``physical_bones_start_simulation`` "
"method. Attach a script to the skeleton node and call the method in the "
"``_ready`` method:"
msgstr ""
"現在布娃娃已經可以開始模擬了。要啟動布娃娃物理並播放動畫，請在骨架"
"（Skeleton）節點掛上腳本，於 ``_ready`` 方法中呼叫 "
"``physical_bones_start_simulation``："

msgid ""
"To stop the simulation, call the ``physical_bones_stop_simulation()`` method."
msgstr "若要停止模擬，請呼叫 ``physical_bones_stop_simulation()`` 方法。"

msgid ""
"You can also limit the simulation to only a few bones. To do so, pass the "
"bone names as a parameter. Here's an example of partial ragdoll simulation:"
msgstr ""
"你也可以只讓部份骨骼參與模擬，方法是將骨骼名稱傳給對應的參數。以下為部分布娃"
"娃模擬的範例："

msgid "Collision layer and mask"
msgstr "碰撞層與遮罩"

msgid ""
"Make sure to set up your collision layers and masks properly so the "
"``CharacterBody3D``'s capsule doesn't get in the way of the physics "
"simulation:"
msgstr ""
"請確認碰撞層與遮罩設定無誤，避免 ``CharacterBody3D`` 的膠囊碰撞體干擾布娃娃物"
