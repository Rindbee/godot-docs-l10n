"It is essential for a game to provide clear, informative, and yet visually "
"pleasing user interface to its players. While :ref:`Control <class_Control>` "
"nodes come with a decently functional look out of the box, there is always "
"room for uniqueness and case-specific tuning. For this purpose Godot engine "
"includes a system for GUI skinning (or theming), which allows you to "
"customize the look of every control in your user interface, including your "
"custom controls."
msgstr ""
"遊戲必須為玩家提供清晰、資訊豐富且視覺上令人愉悅的使用者介面。雖"
"然 :ref:`Control <class_Control>` 節點預設就有相當實用的外觀，但仍有不少空間"

"Beyond achieving a unique look for your game, this system also enables "
"developers to provide customization options to the end users, including "
"accessibility settings. UI themes are applied in a cascading manner (i.e. "
"they propagate from parent controls to their children), which means that "
"font settings or adjustments for colorblind users can be applied in a single "
"place and affect the entire UI tree. Of course this system can also be used "
"for gameplay purposes: your hero-based game can change its style for the "
"selected player character, or you can give different flavors to the sides in "
"your team-based project."
msgstr ""
"除了為遊戲打造獨特外觀外，這套系統也讓開發者能為終端使用者提供自訂選項，包括"
"無障礙設定。UI 主題是以階層方式套用（也就是會從父控制項向下傳遞到子控制項），"
"這代表像字型設定或色盲相關調整，都能在單一處設定並影響整個 UI 樹狀結構。當"

msgid "Basics of themes"
msgstr "主題基礎"

msgid ""
"The skinning system is driven by the :ref:`Theme <class_Theme>` resource. "
"Every Godot project has an inherent default theme that contains the settings "
"used by the built-in control nodes. This is what gives the controls their "
"distinct look out of the box. A theme only describes the configuration, "
"however, and it is still the job of each individual control to use that "
"configuration in the way it requires to display itself. This is important to "
"remember when implementing :ref:`your own custom controls "
"<doc_custom_gui_controls>`."
msgstr ""
"換膚系統是由 :ref:`Theme <class_Theme>` 資源驅動。每個 Godot 專案都有一個內建"
"的預設主題，包含所有內建控制項預設的外觀設定。這就是控制項預設外觀的來源。不"
"過主題僅僅描述設定，實際如何運用這些設定來顯示，仍取決於各個控制項本身。這點"
"在你實作 :ref:`自訂控制項 <doc_custom_gui_controls>` 時一定要注意。"

msgid ""
"Even the Godot editor itself relies on the default theme. But it doesn't "
"look the same as a Godot project, because it applies its own heavily "
"customized theme on top of the default one. In principle, this works exactly "
"like it would in your game as explained :ref:`below "
"<doc_gui_theme_in_project>`."
msgstr ""
"連 Godot 編輯器本身也依賴預設主題。但編輯器看起來和一般 Godot 專案不同，因為"
"它在預設主題之上，疊加了高度自訂的主題。原則上這和你的遊戲專案的運作方式完全"
"一樣，詳見 :ref:`下方說明 <doc_gui_theme_in_project>`。"

msgid "Theme items"

msgid "**Font**"
msgstr "**字型**"

msgid ""
"A :ref:`font <class_Font>` resource, which is used by controls that display "

msgid "**StyleBox**"
msgstr "**StyleBox**"

msgid ""
"A :ref:`StyleBox <class_StyleBox>` resource, a collection of configuration "

msgid ""
"Different controls will apply StyleBoxes in a different manner. Most "
"notably, ``focus`` styleboxes are drawn as an *overlay* to other styleboxes "
"(such as ``normal`` or ``pressed``) to allow the base stylebox to remain "
"visible. This means the focus stylebox should be designed as an outline or "
"translucent box, so that its background can remain visible."
msgstr ""
"不同控制項會以不同方式套用 StyleBox。特別的是，``focus`` StyleBox 會被繪製為"
"其他 StyleBox（例如 ``normal`` 或 ``pressed``）的*覆蓋層*，以便基礎 StyleBox "

msgid "Theme types"
msgstr "主題型別"

msgid ""
"To help with the organization of its items each theme is separated into "
"types, and each item must belong to a single type. In other words, each "
"theme item is defined by its name, its data type and its theme type. This "

"two color items named ``font_color`` in a type called ``Label``, but there "
"can be another ``font_color`` item in a type ``LineEdit``."
msgstr ""
"為了方便組織管理，各主題會依型別區分，每個項目只能屬於一個型別。換句話說，每"

"一。例如，``Label`` 型別下不能有兩個叫 ``font_color`` 的顏色項目，但 "
"``LineEdit`` 型別下則可有另一個 ``font_color`` 項目。"

msgid ""
"The default Godot theme comes with multiple theme types already defined, one "
"for every built-in control node that uses UI skinning. The example above "
"contains actual theme items present in the default theme. You can refer to "
"the **Theme Properties** section in the class reference for each control to "
"see which items are available to it and its child classes."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的預設主題已經定義了多種主題型別，對應所有支援 UI 換膚的內建控制項節"
"點。上面範例中提到的，就是預設主題實際存在的項目。你可以查閱各控制項的類別參"
"考文件中的「主題屬性」章節，了解哪些項目可用於該類別及其子類別。"

msgid ""
"Child classes can use theme items defined for their parent class (``Button`` "
"and its derivatives being a good example of that). In fact, every control "
"can use every theme item of any theme type, if it needs to (but for the "
"clarity and predictability we try to avoid that in the engine)."
msgstr ""
"子類別可以使用父類別定義的主題項目（例如 ``Button`` 及其衍生類別）。其實每個"
"控制項理論上都能使用任何型別下的主題項目（但為了清晰性與可預測性，引擎實作上"
"會盡量避免這樣做）。"

msgid ""
"It is important to remember that for child classes that process is "
"automated. Whenever a built-in control requests a theme item from the theme "
"it can omit the theme type, and its class name will be used instead. On top "
"of that, the class names of its parent classes will also be used in turn. "
"This allows changes to the parent class, such as ``Button``, to affect all "
"derived classes without the need to customize every one of them."
msgstr ""
"要注意，對子類別來說這個流程是自動化的。當內建控制項向主題請求主題項目時，可"
"以省略主題型別，會直接使用其類別名稱，接著也會依序查找其父類別名稱。這樣一"
"來，像修改 ``Button`` 父類別的主題項目，就能影響所有衍生類別，而無須一一調"
"整。"

msgid ""
"You can also define your own theme types, and additionally customize both "
"built-in controls and your own controls. Because built-in controls have no "
"knowledge of your custom theme types, you must utilize scripts to access "
"those items. All control nodes have several methods that allow you to fetch "
"theme items from the theme that is applied to them. Those methods accept the "
"theme type as one of the arguments."
msgstr ""
"你也能自訂主題型別，進一步自訂內建控制項或你自己的控制項。不過，內建控制項不"
"會自動識別你的自訂主題型別，因此你必須透過腳本來存取這些項目。所有控制項節點"
"都有多種方法可從當前主題中取得主題項目，這些方法都能接受主題型別作為參數。"

msgid ""
"To give more customization opportunities types can also be linked together "
"as type variations. This is another use-case for custom theme types. For "
"example, a theme can contain a type ``Header`` which can be marked as a "
"variation of the base ``Label`` type. An individual ``Label`` control can "
"then be set to use the ``Header`` variation for its type, and every time a "
"theme item is requested from a theme this variation will be used before any "
"other type. This allows to store various presets of theme items for the same "
"class of the control node in the single ``Theme`` resource."
msgstr ""
"為了提供更多自訂彈性，型別之間也能設計成變種。這是自訂主題型別的另一個應用，"
"例如主題中可以有個 ``Header`` 型別，標記為 ``Label`` 基礎型別的變種。個別 "
"``Label`` 控制項就可以指定型別為 ``Header``，之後每次請求主題項目時，會優先使"
"用這個變種。這樣就能在同一個 ``Theme`` 資源中，為同一類型的控制項儲存不同的主"
"題項目預設值。"

msgid ""
"Only variations available from the default theme or defined in the custom "
"project theme are shown in the Inspector dock as options. You can still "
"input manually the name of a variation that is defined outside of those two "
"places, but it is recommended to keep all variations to the project theme."
msgstr ""
"只有預設主題或自訂專案主題中的變種，會在屬性檢視器裡顯示為可選項。你仍可手動"
"輸入其他地方定義的變種名稱，但建議所有變種都統一放在專案主題中。"

msgid "Customizing a control"
msgstr "自訂控制項"

msgid ""
"Each control node can be customized directly without the use of themes. This "
"is called local overrides. Every theme property from the control's class "
"reference can be overridden directly on the control itself, using either the "
"Inspector dock, or scripts. This allows to make granular changes to a "
"particular part of the UI, while not affecting anything else in the project, "
"including this control's children."
msgstr ""
"每個控制項節點都可以不透過主題而直接自訂，這稱為本地覆寫。你可以在屬性檢視器"
"或用腳本，直接覆寫控制項類別參考中列出的每一個主題屬性。這能讓你細緻調整介面"
"的某一部分，而不影響專案其他部分，包括這個控制項的子項。"

msgid ""
"Local overrides are less useful for the visual flair of your user interface, "
"especially if you aim for consistency. However, for layout nodes these are "
"essential. Nodes such as :ref:`BoxContainer <class_BoxContainer>` "
"and :ref:`GridContainer <class_GridContainer>` use theme constants for "
"defining separation between their children, and :ref:`MarginContainer "
"<class_MarginContainer>` stores its customizable margins in its theme items."
msgstr ""
"本地覆寫對於整體 UI 美觀幫助有限，尤其當你追求一致性時更是如此。不過，對於排"
"版用的節點來說則相當重要。像 :ref:`BoxContainer <class_BoxContainer>` "
"與 :ref:`GridContainer <class_GridContainer>` 這類節點會用主題常數來定義子項"
"間距；:ref:`MarginContainer <class_MarginContainer>` 則會將自訂邊界存於主題項"
"目中。"

msgid ""
"Whenever a control has a local theme item override, this is the value that "
"it uses. Values provided by the theme are ignored."
msgstr ""
"當控制項有本地主題項目覆寫時，會優先使用這個值，主題所提供的值則會被忽略。"

msgid "Customizing a project"
msgstr "自訂專案"

msgid ""
"Out of the box each project adopts the default project theme provided by "
"Godot. The default theme itself is constant and cannot be changed, but its "

"two ways: as a project setting, and as a node property throughout the tree "
"of control nodes."
msgstr ""
"每個新專案預設都會採用 Godot 提供的預設專案主題。預設主題本身是固定的、無法修"

msgid ""
"This allows you to configure the default look of every Godot control with a "
"single theme resource, but you can go more granular than that. Every control "
"node also has a :ref:`theme <class_Control_property_theme>` property, which "
"allows you to set a custom theme for the branch of nodes starting with that "
"control. This means that the control and all of its children, and their "
"children in turn, would first check that custom theme resource before "
"falling back on the project and the default themes."

"對該節點及其所有子孫節點設定自訂主題。換句話說，這個控制項及其子孫節點會優先"

msgid ""
"Instead of changing the project setting you can set the custom theme "
"resource to the root-most control node of your entire UI branch to almost "
"the same effect. While in the running project it will behave as expected, "

msgstr ""
"你可以選擇不更動專案設定，而是將自訂主題資源設定到 UI 架構中最上層的控制項節"
"點，效果幾乎相同。在專案執行時會如預期顯示，但如果你直接預覽或運行單一場景，"
