msgid "Basic XR Locomotion"
msgstr "基礎 XR 移動"

msgid ""
"For basic locomotion we're going to continue using our Godot XR Tools "
"library. The library contains both basic movement features as more advanced "
"features."
msgstr ""
"在基礎移動方面，我們會持續使用 Godot XR Tools 工具庫。這個工具庫同時包含基礎"
"移動功能與進階功能。"

msgid "Adding our player body"
msgstr "新增玩家本體"

msgid ""
"The first step we need to do is to add a helper node to our :ref:`XROrigin3D "
"<class_xrorigin3d>` node. Because XR supports roomscale tracking you can't "
"simply add your XR setup to a :ref:`CharacterBody3D <class_characterbody3d>` "
"node and expect things to work. You will run into trouble when the user "
"moves around their physical space and is no longer standing in the center of "
"their room. Godot XR Tools embeds the needed logic into a helper node called "
"``PlayerBody``."
msgstr ""
"第一步是為 :ref:`XROrigin3D <class_xrorigin3d>` 節點新增一個輔助節點。由於 "
"XR 支援 Roomscale 空間定位，你不能直接將 XR 設定掛載在 :ref:`CharacterBody3D "
"<class_characterbody3d>` 節點並期待一切正常運作。當使用者在現實空間中移動，不"
"再站在房間中心時，這將導致問題。Godot XR Tools 已將所需邏輯封裝於一個名為 "
"``PlayerBody`` 的輔助節點。"

msgid ""
"Select your :ref:`XROrigin3D <class_xrorigin3d>` node and click on the "
"``instantiate Child Scene`` button to add a child scene. Select ``addons/"
"godot-xr-tools/player/player_body.tscn`` and add this node."
msgstr ""
"選取 :ref:`XROrigin3D <class_xrorigin3d>` 節點，點擊「實例化子場景」按鈕來加"
"入子場景。選擇 ``addons/godot-xr-tools/player/player_body.tscn``，並將此節點"
"新增進來。"

msgid "Adding a floor"
msgstr "新增地板"

msgid ""
"This node governs the in game movement of your character and will "
"immediately react to gravity. So to prevent our player from infinitely "
"falling down we'll quickly add a floor to our scene."
msgstr ""
"這個節點負責角色在遊戲內的移動，並會即時受到重力影響。為了防止玩家角色無限墜"
"落，我們要在場景中快速新增一個地板。"

msgid "Direct movement"
msgstr "直接移動"

msgid ""
"We're going to start adding some basic direct movement to our setup. This "
"allows the user to move through the virtual world using joystick input."
msgstr ""
"接下來我們要在專案中加入基本的「直接移動」功能，讓使用者可透過搖桿在虛擬世界"
"中移動。"

msgid ""
"It is important to note that moving through the virtual world while the "
"player is standing still in the real world, can be nausea inducing "
"especially for players who are new to VR. The default settings on our "
"movement functions are fairly conservative. We advise you to stick to these "
"defaults but offer features in game to enable less comfortable settings for "
"more experienced users who are used to playing VR games."
msgstr ""
"值得注意的是，當玩家在現實中靜止時於虛擬世界移動，容易引發暈眩感，尤其是對於"
"剛接觸 VR 的新手玩家。預設的移動參數相當保守。我們建議預設採用這些安全設定，"
"但同時在遊戲中提供選項，讓有經驗的玩家可以啟用較刺激的移動方式。"

msgid ""
"We want to enable this on the right hand controller. We do this by adding a "
"subscene to the right hand :ref:`XRController3D <class_xrcontroller3d>` "
"node. Select ``addons/godot-xr-tools/functions/movement_direct.tscn`` as the "
"scene to add."
msgstr ""
"我們希望在右手控制器上啟用這個功能。請在右手 :ref:`XRController3D "
"<class_xrcontroller3d>` 節點下新增一個子場景，選擇 ``addons/godot-xr-tools/"
"functions/movement_direct.tscn`` 作為要加入的場景。"

msgid ""
"This function adds forward and backwards movement to the player by using the "
"joystick on the right hand controller. It has an option to also add left/"
"right strafe but by default this is disabled."
msgstr ""
"這個功能讓玩家可透過右手控制器的搖桿進行前進與後退移動。此外，還可選擇啟用左"
"右側移，但預設為關閉。"

msgid ""
"Instead, we are going to add the ability for the player to also turn with "
"this joystick. We will add another subscene to our controller node, select "
"``addons/godot-xr-tools/functions/movement_turn.tscn`` for this."
msgstr ""
"另外，我們也要加入讓玩家可用同一個搖桿進行轉向的功能。請為控制器節點再新增一"
"個子場景，選擇 ``addons/godot-xr-tools/functions/movement_turn.tscn``。"

msgid ""
"The turn system by default uses a snap turn approach. This means that "
"turning happens in steps. This may seem jarring however it is a tried and "
"tested method of combating motion sickness. You can easily switch to a mode "
"that offers smooth turning by changing the ``mode`` property on the turn "
"node."
msgstr ""
"預設的轉向系統採用「快速轉向」方式，也就是以分段方式轉動。雖然這種方式感覺較"
"突兀，但已被證實能有效減少暈動症。你可以透過調整轉向節點的 ``mode`` 屬性，輕"
"鬆切換為平滑轉向模式。"

msgid ""
"If you run your game at this point in time you will find that you can move "
"through the world freely using the right hand joystick."
msgstr "此時如果執行遊戲，你會發現可以用右手搖桿在世界中自由移動。"

msgid "Teleport"
msgstr "傳送"

msgid ""
"An alternative to direct movement that some users find more pleasant is the "
"ability to teleport to another location within your game world. Godot XR "
"Tools supports this through the teleport function and we will be adding this "
"to our left hand controller."
msgstr ""
"有些玩家會覺得「傳送」比直接移動更舒適。Godot XR Tools 內建傳送功能，我們將把"
"這個功能加到左手控制器上。"

msgid ""
"Add a new child scene to your left hand :ref:`XRController3D "
"<class_xrcontroller3d>` node by selecting the ``addons/godot-xr-tools/"
"functions/function_teleport.tscn`` scene."
msgstr ""
"請在左手 :ref:`XRController3D <class_xrcontroller3d>` 節點下新增一個子場景，"
"選擇 ``addons/godot-xr-tools/functions/function_teleport.tscn`` 場景。"

msgid ""
"If you've followed all instructions correctly your scene should now look "
"something like this:"
msgstr "如果你都正確操作，現在場景應該會長得像這樣："

msgid "More advanced movement features"
msgstr "更多進階移動功能"

msgid ""
"Godot XR Tools adds many more movement features such as gliding, a grapple "
"hook implementation, a jetpack, climbing mechanics, etc."
msgstr "Godot XR Tools 還提供滑翔、抓鉤、噴射背包、攀爬等多種進階移動機制。"

msgid ""
"Most work similarly to the basic movement features we've handled so far, "
"simply add the relevant subscene from the plugin to the controller that "
"implements it."
msgstr ""
"大部分的進階功能和前述基礎移動功能用法相似，只需將對應的子場景新增到控制器即"
"可。"

msgid ""
"We'll look at some of these in more detail later on in this tutorial where "
"additional setup is required (such as climbing) but for others please look "
"at Godot XR Tools own help pages for details."
msgstr ""
"本教學稍後會針對需要特殊設定（如攀爬）的功能做進一步說明，其他功能請參考 "
"Godot XR Tools 自帶的說明文件。"
