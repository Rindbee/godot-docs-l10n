msgid "OpenXR Settings"
msgstr "OpenXR 設定"

msgid ""
"OpenXR has its own set of settings that are applied when OpenXR starts. "
"While it is possible for OpenXR extensions implemented through Godot plugins "
"to add additional settings, we will only discuss the settings in the core of "
"Godot here."
msgstr ""
"OpenXR 有其專屬的一組設定，會在 OpenXR 啟動時套用。雖然透過 Godot 外掛實作的 "
"OpenXR 擴充功能可以額外加入設定，本章僅說明 Godot 核心中的設定。"

msgid "Enabled"
msgstr "已啟用"

msgid ""
"This setting enables the OpenXR module when Godot starts. This is required "
"when the Vulkan backend is used. For other backends you can enable OpenXR at "
"any time by calling ``initialize`` on the :ref:`OpenXRInterface "
"<class_openxrinterface>`."
msgstr ""
"此設定會在 Godot 啟動時啟用 OpenXR 模組。若使用 Vulkan 後端，這是必要的。對於"
"其他後端，你可以隨時呼叫 :ref:`OpenXRInterface <class_openxrinterface>` 的 "
"``initialize`` 方法來啟用 OpenXR。"

msgid "This also needs to be enabled to get access to the action map editor."
msgstr "若要使用動作對應編輯器，也必須啟用此設定。"

msgid ""
"You can use the ``--xr-mode on`` command line switch to force this to on."
msgstr "你可以在啟動時加入 ``--xr-mode on`` 命令列參數來強制啟用此功能。"

msgid "Default Action Map"
msgstr "預設動作對應"

msgid ""
"This specifies the path of the action map file that OpenXR will load and "
"communicate to the XR Runtime."
msgstr "這裡設定 OpenXR 載入並傳遞給 XR 執行時（Runtime）的動作對應檔案路徑。"

msgid "Form Factor"
msgstr "裝置型態"

msgid "This specifies whether your game is designed for:"
msgstr "這裡指定你的遊戲是針對以下哪一種裝置設計："

msgid ""
"``Head Mounted`` devices such as a Meta Quest, Valve Index, or Magic Leap,"
msgstr "「頭戴式」裝置，例如 Meta Quest、Valve Index 或 Magic Leap，"

msgid "``Handheld`` devices such as phones."
msgstr "「手持式」裝置，例如智慧型手機。"

msgid ""
"If the device on which you run your game does not match the selection here, "
"OpenXR will fail to initialise."
msgstr "若執行遊戲的裝置與此處選擇的類型不符，OpenXR 將無法初始化。"

msgid "View Configuration"
msgstr "視圖配置"

msgid "This specifies the view configuration your game is designed for:"
msgstr "這裡設定你的遊戲設計所使用的視圖配置："

msgid ""
"``Mono``, your game provides a single image output. E.g. phone based AR;"
msgstr "「單眼」：遊戲僅提供單一畫面輸出。例如：基於手機的 AR;"

msgid ""
"``Stereo``, your game provides stereo image output. E.g. head mounted "
"devices."
msgstr "「立體」：遊戲提供立體畫面輸出。例如：頭戴式裝置。"

msgid ""
"OpenXR has additional view configurations for very specific devices that "
"Godot doesn't support yet. For instance, Varjo headsets have a quad view "
"configuration that outputs two sets of stereo images. These may be supported "
"in the near future."
msgstr ""
"OpenXR 還有其他專為特定裝置設計的視圖配置，目前 Godot 尚未支援。例如 Varjo 頭"

msgid "Reference Space"
msgstr "參考空間"

msgid ""
"Within XR all elements like the player's head and hands are tracked within a "
"tracking volume. At the base of this tracking volume is our origin point, "
"which maps our virtual space to the real space. There are however different "
"scenarios that place this point in different locations, depending on the XR "
"system used. In OpenXR these scenarios are well defined and selected by "
"setting a reference space."
msgstr ""
"在 XR 中，玩家的頭部、手部等所有元素都會在一個追蹤空間（tracking volume）內進"
"行追蹤。這個追蹤空間的基準點（origin）負責將虛擬空間對應到現實空間。根據不同 "
"XR 系統，這個基準點的位置會有所不同。在 OpenXR 中，這些情境有明確定義，並可透"
"過設定參考空間來選擇。"

msgid "Local"
msgstr "本地"

msgid ""
"The local reference space places our origin point at the player's head by "
"default. Some XR runtimes will do this each time your game starts, others "
"will make the position persist over sessions."
msgstr ""
"「本地」參考空間預設會將原點設在玩家的頭部。有些 XR 執行時會在每次遊戲啟動時"
"這麼做，其他則會讓此位置在多次遊玩期間持續保持。"

msgid ""
"This reference space however does not prevent the user from walking away so "
"you will need to detect if the user does so if you wish to prevent the user "
"from leaving the vehicle they are controlling, which could potentially be "
"game breaking."
msgstr ""
"此參考空間無法防止使用者離開原點，因此如果你希望玩家不要離開所控制的載具等，"
"必須自行偵測玩家是否已移動，否則可能會導致遊戲體驗破壞。"

msgid ""
"This reference space is the best option for games like flight simulators or "
"racing simulators where we want to place the :ref:`XROrigin3D "
"<class_xrorigin3d>` node where the player's head should be."
msgstr ""
"這種參考空間最適合像是飛行模擬或賽車模擬等遊戲，在這些遊戲中我們希望"
"將 :ref:`XROrigin3D <class_xrorigin3d>` 節點放在玩家頭部的位置。"

msgid ""
"When the user enacts the recenter option on their headset, the method of "
"which is different per XR runtime, the XR runtime will move "
"the :ref:`XRCamera3D <class_xrcamera3d>` to the :ref:`XROrigin3D "

msgstr "使用此參考空間時， **不應該** 呼叫 ``center_on_hmd`` 。"

msgid "Stage"
msgstr "舞台"

msgid ""
"The stage reference space is our default reference space and places our "
"origin point at the center of our play space. For XR runtimes that allow you "
"to draw out a guardian boundary this location and its orientation is often "
"set by the user. Other XR runtimes may decide on the placement of this point "
"by other means. It is however a stationary point in the real world."
msgstr ""
"舞台（Stage）參考空間是預設的參考空間，會將原點設置於遊玩區域的中心。對於允許"
"繪製防護邊界的 XR 執行時，這個位置及方向通常由使用者設定。其他 XR 執行時則可"
"能用不同方式決定基準點，但這個點在現實世界中通常是固定的。"

msgid ""
"This reference space is the best option for room scale games where the user "
"is expected to walk around a larger space, or for games where there is a "
"need to switch between game modes. See :ref:`Room Scale <doc_xr_room_scale>` "
"for more information."
msgstr ""
"這種參考空間最適合房間規模（Room Scale）遊戲，玩家預期會在較大的空間內移動，"
"或是需要切換不同遊戲模式的情境。詳見 :ref:`Room Scale <doc_xr_room_scale>`。"

msgid ""
"When the user enacts the recenter option on their headset, the method of "
"which is different per XR runtime, the XR runtime will not change the origin "
"point. The :ref:`OpenXRInterface <class_openxrinterface>` will emit the "
"``pose_recentered`` signal and it is up to the game to react appropriately. "
"Not doing so will prevent your game from being accepted on various stores."
msgstr ""
"當使用者在頭戴裝置上執行重新置中時（每種 XR 執行時方式不同），XR 執行時不會更"
"動原點位置。:ref:`OpenXRInterface <class_openxrinterface>` 會發出 "

msgstr ""
"在 Godot 中，你可以呼叫 :ref:`XRServer <class_xrserver>` 的 "
"``center_on_hmd`` 方法來達成此目的："

msgid ""
"Calling ``XRServer.center_on_hmd(XRServer.RESET_BUT_KEEP_TILT, true)`` will "

msgstr ""
"呼叫 ``XRServer.center_on_hmd(XRServer.RESET_BUT_KEEP_TILT, true)`` 會"
"將 :ref:`XRCamera3D <class_xrcamera3d>` 節點移動到 :ref:`XROrigin3D "
"<class_xrorigin3d>` 節點上方並保留玩家高度，類似於「本地地板」參考空間。"

msgid "Local Floor"
msgstr "本地地板"

msgid ""
"The local floor reference space is similar to the local reference space as "
"it positions the origin point where the player is. In this mode however the "
"height of the player is kept. Same as with the local reference space, some "
"XR runtimes will persist this location over sessions."
msgstr ""
"本地地板參考空間與本地參考空間類似，都是將原點設於玩家所在位置，但此模式會保"
"留玩家的高度。與本地參考空間一樣，有些 XR 執行時會讓這個位置於多次遊戲期間持"
"續存在。"

msgid ""
"It is thus not guaranteed the player will be standing on the origin point, "
"the only guarantee is that they were standing there when the user last "
"recentered. The player is thus also free to walk away."
msgstr ""
"因此無法保證玩家始終站在原點上，只能保證他們在上次重新置中時站在那裡。玩家之"
"後仍可自由離開原點。"

msgid ""
"This reference space is the best option of games where the user is expected "
"to stand in the same location or for AR type games where the user's "
"interface elements are bound to the origin node and are quickly placed at "
"the player's location on recenter."
msgstr ""
"這種參考空間最適合預期玩家會站在原地的遊戲，或是類 AR 遊戲，其 UI 元素綁定於"
"原點節點並可在重置時快速對齊玩家位置。"

msgid ""
"When the user enacts the recenter option on their headset, the method of "

msgid ""
"Be careful using this mode in combination with virtual movement of the "
"player. The user recentering in this scenario can be unpredictable unless "
"you counter the move when handling the recenter signal. This can even be "
"game breaking as the effect in this scenario would be the player teleporting "
"to whatever abstract location the origin point was placed at during virtual "
"movement, including the ability for players teleporting into locations that "
"should be off limits. It is better to use the Stage mode in this scenario "
"and limit resetting to orientation only when a ``pose_recentered`` signal is "
"received."
msgstr ""
"若你讓玩家進行虛擬移動時使用此模式要特別小心。玩家在這種情境下執行重新置中會"
"產生不可預期的結果，除非你在處理重新置中訊號時自行修正移動，否則可能造成玩家"
"瞬間被傳送至虛擬移動時設定的原點座標，甚至進入不應進入的區域。這種情境建議改"

msgid "``Opaque`` means our output obscures the real world, we are in VR mode."
msgstr "「Opaque」（不透明）：渲染結果完全遮蔽現實世界，即 VR 模式。"

msgid ""
"``Additive`` means our output is added to the real world, this is an AR mode "

msgstr "若選擇的混合模式未被頭戴裝置支援，將自動選擇第一個可用的模式。"

msgid ""
"Some OpenXR devices have separate systems for enabling/disabling "

msgid "Foveation Level"
msgstr "注視點最佳化等級"

msgid ""
"Sets the foveation level used when rendering provided this feature is "
"supported by the hardware used. Foveation is a technique where the further "

"take eye tracking into account and use the focal point for this effect."
msgstr ""
"設定渲染時使用的注視點最佳化（Foveation）等級，前提是硬體有支援。注視點最佳化"

msgid "Foveation Dynamic"
msgstr "動態注視點最佳化"

msgid ""
"When enabled the foveation level will be adjusted automatically depending on "

msgstr "**僅限相容性渲染器**"

msgid "Submit Depth Buffer"
msgstr "提交深度緩衝區"

msgid ""
"If enabled an OpenXR supplied depth buffer will be used while rendering "
"which is submitted alongside the rendered image. The XR runtime can use this "
"for improved reprojection."
msgstr ""
"啟用後，渲染時會使用由 OpenXR 提供的深度緩衝區，並於影像一同提交。XR 執行時可"

msgid ""
"Enabling this feature will disable stencil support during rendering. Not "
"many XR runtimes make use of this, it is advised to leave this setting off "
"unless it provides noticeable benefits for your use case."
msgstr ""
"啟用此功能會關閉渲染時的遮罩（stencil）支援。大多數 XR 執行時不會用到此功能，"
