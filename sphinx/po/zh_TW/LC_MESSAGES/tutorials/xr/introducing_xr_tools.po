msgid "Introducing XR tools"
msgstr "XR 工具簡介"

msgid ""
"Out of the box Godot gives you all the basic support to setup an XR project. "
"XR specific game mechanics however need to be implemented on top of this "
"foundation. While Godot makes this relatively easy this can still be a "
"daunting task."
msgstr ""
"Godot 開箱即用地提供了設定 XR 專案所需的所有基本支援。不過，XR 特有的遊戲機制"
"還需要在這個基礎上自行實作。雖然 Godot 有助於簡化這個過程，但這依然可能是一項"
"艱鉅的任務。"

msgid ""
"For this reason Godot has developed a toolkit called `Godot XR Tools "
"<https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools>`_ that implements many of the "
"basic mechanics found in XR games, from locomotion to object interaction to "
"UI interaction."
msgstr ""
"因此，Godot 開發了一套名為 `Godot XR Tools <https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-"
"xr-tools>`_ 的工具包，實作了許多 XR 遊戲常見的基本機制，從移動、物件互動到 "
"UI 操作等一應俱全。"

msgid ""
"This toolkit is designed to work with both OpenXR and WebXR runtimes. We'll "
"be using this as a base for our documentation here. It helps developers hit "
"the ground running but for more specific use cases building your own logic "
"is just as valid. In that case XR tools can help in providing inspiration."
msgstr ""
"這個工具包設計上同時支援 OpenXR 與 WebXR 執行環境。我們將以此為本章文件的基"
"礎。它能協助開發者快速上手，但若有更特殊需求，自行撰寫邏輯也完全可行。此時 "
"XR 工具也能作為設計靈感的來源。"

msgid "Installing XR Tools"
msgstr "安裝 XR 工具"

msgid ""
"Next open the ``Project`` menu and select ``Project Settings..``. Now go to "
"the ``Plugins`` tab and enable the plugin."
msgstr ""
"然後，開啟 ``專案`` 功能表並選擇 ``專案設定...``，再切換到 ``外掛程式`` 分頁"
"並啟用該插件。"

msgid "Basic hands"
msgstr "基本手部模型"

msgid ""
"Just to get a feel of things we're going to add a few standard components "
"that dress up our scene starting with hands for our player."
msgstr ""
"為了讓你熟悉操作，我們將從為玩家加入手部模型開始，新增幾個標準組件來美化場"
"景。"

msgid ""
"OpenXR supports full hand tracking however there currently are significant "
"differences in capabilities between the different XR Runtimes."
msgstr "OpenXR 支援完整的手部追蹤，但目前各 XR 執行環境在功能上仍有顯著差異。"

msgid ""
"As a reliable alternative Godot XR Tools comes with a number of rigged hand "
"scenes that react on trigger and grip inputs of your controller. These hands "
"come in low and high poly versions, come in a few configurations, a number "
"of animation files to control finger positions and a number of different "
"textures."
msgstr ""
"作為可靠的替代方案，Godot XR Tools 提供多種已綁定骨架的手部場景，可對控制器的"
"扳機與握把輸入做出反應。這些手模型分為低多邊形與高多邊形版本，並有多種組合、"
"控制手指位置的動畫檔案，以及不同的材質紋理。"

msgid ""
"As you can see from the path of this scene, low poly models are in the "
"``lowpoly`` subfolder while high poly models are in the ``highpoly`` "
"subfolder. You will want to use the low poly versions if you plan to release "
"your game on mobile devices."
msgstr ""
"如從路徑所見，低多邊形模型位於 ``lowpoly`` 子資料夾，高多邊形則在 "
"``highpoly`` 子資料夾。若你打算將遊戲發佈至行動裝置，建議使用低多邊形版本。"

msgid "The default hand we chose is just a hand. The other options are:"
msgstr "預設選用的僅為普通手部模型，其他選項還有："

msgid "tac_glove - the hand is wearing a glove with fingers exposed"
msgstr "tac_glove —— 帶指頭外露的手套"

msgid "full_glove - the hand is wearing a glove that covers the entire hand"
msgstr "full_glove —— 覆蓋整隻手的手套"

msgid ""
"Finally each hand comes in a ``physics`` version. This exposes all the "
"bones. We'll look at how that can be used in another tutorial."
msgstr ""
"此外，每種手部模型都提供 ``physics`` 版本，可顯示全部骨架。詳細用法將於其他教"
"學介紹。"

msgid "We repeat the same for the right hand."
msgstr "右手亦重複相同步驟。"

msgid "More information"
msgstr "更多資訊"

msgid ""
"We'll continue with adding features to our tutorial project using Godot XR "
"tools in the next couple of pages. More detailed information about the "
"toolkit can be found `on the toolkits help pages <https://godotvr.github.io/"
"godot-xr-tools/>`_."
msgstr ""
"接下來的幾頁，將持續示範如何利用 Godot XR 工具為教學專案新增功能。若需進一步"
"了解，請參考 `工具包的說明頁面 <https://godotvr.github.io/godot-xr-tools/"
