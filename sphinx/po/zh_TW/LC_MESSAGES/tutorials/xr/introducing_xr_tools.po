"Out of the box Godot gives you all the basic support to setup an XR project. "
"XR specific game mechanics however need to be implemented on top of this "
"foundation. While Godot makes this relatively easy this can still be a "
"daunting task."
msgstr ""
"Godot 開箱即用地提供了設定 XR 專案所需的所有基本支援。不過，XR 特有的遊戲機制"
"還需要在這個基礎上自行實作。雖然 Godot 有助於簡化這個過程，但這依然可能是一項"
"艱鉅的任務。"

msgid ""
"For this reason Godot has developed a toolkit called `Godot XR Tools "
"<https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools>`_ that implements many of the "
"basic mechanics found in XR games, from locomotion to object interaction to "
"UI interaction."
msgstr ""
"因此，Godot 開發了一套名為 `Godot XR Tools <https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-"
"xr-tools>`_ 的工具包，實作了許多 XR 遊戲常見的基本機制，從移動、物件互動到 "
"UI 操作等一應俱全。"

msgid ""
"This toolkit is designed to work with both OpenXR and WebXR runtimes. We'll "
"be using this as a base for our documentation here. It helps developers hit "
"the ground running but for more specific use cases building your own logic "
"is just as valid. In that case XR tools can help in providing inspiration."
msgstr ""
"這個工具包設計上同時支援 OpenXR 與 WebXR 執行環境。我們將以此為本章文件的基"
"礎。它能協助開發者快速上手，但若有更特殊需求，自行撰寫邏輯也完全可行。此時 "
"XR 工具也能作為設計靈感的來源。"

msgid "Installing XR Tools"
msgstr "安裝 XR 工具"

msgid ""
"Continuing on from our project we started in :ref:`doc_setting_up_xr` we "
"want to add in the Godot XR Tools library. This can be downloaded from the "
"`Godot XR Tools releases page <https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-tools/"
"releases>`_. Find the latest release for Godot 4, and under **Assets**, "
"download the ``godot-xr-tools.zip`` file. You can also find it in the asset "
"library with the title \"Godot XR Tools for Godot 4\"."
msgstr ""
"延續我們在 :ref:`doc_setting_up_xr` 開始的專案，現在要加入 Godot XR Tools 函"
"式庫。可以從 `Godot XR Tools 發行頁 <https://github.com/GodotVR/godot-xr-"
"tools/releases>`_ 下載。找到 Godot 4 的最新發行版，於 **Assets** 底下下載 "

"If you're using the zip file, once it's downloaded unzip it. You will notice "
"the files are held within a ``godot-xr-tools`` subfolder. Inside of this "
"folder you will find an ``addons`` folder. It is this folder that you want "
"to copy in its entirety to your Godot project folder. Your project should "

msgstr ""
"若你是使用 zip 壓縮檔，下載完成後請解壓縮。你會發現所有檔案皆位於 ``godot-xr-"

msgid ""
"Now open up your project in Godot, if you haven't already, and give it a "
"minute or so to import all the resources of the plugin. If it asks for a "
"path to Blender to be set you can just click the option to disable blender "
"import and restart the editor."
msgstr ""
"接著於 Godot 開啟你的專案（若尚未開啟），並稍待片刻，讓所有外掛資源完成匯入。"
"若彈出要求設定 Blender 路徑的提示，你可以直接選擇停用 Blender 匯入，然後重新"

msgid ""
"After the import finishes you may notice that several \"failed to load "
"script\" messages popped up, that's normal, the plugin just needs to be "
"enabled in the project settings."
msgstr ""
"匯入完成後，你可能會看到數個「failed to load script」訊息彈出。這是正常的，只"

"the ``Plugins`` tab and enable the plugin."
msgstr ""
"然後，開啟 ``專案`` 功能表並選擇 ``專案設定...``，再切換到 ``外掛程式`` 分頁"

msgid ""
"After doing that you need to close and re-open your project so everything is "

msgstr "OpenXR 支援完整的手部追蹤，但目前各 XR 執行環境在功能上仍有顯著差異。"

msgid ""
"As a reliable alternative Godot XR Tools comes with a number of rigged hand "
"scenes that react on trigger and grip inputs of your controller. These hands "
"come in low and high poly versions, come in a few configurations, a number "
"of animation files to control finger positions and a number of different "
"textures."
msgstr ""
"作為可靠的替代方案，Godot XR Tools 提供多種已綁定骨架的手部場景，可對控制器的"

msgid ""
"As you can see from the path of this scene, low poly models are in the "

"your game on mobile devices."
msgstr ""
"如從路徑所見，低多邊形模型位於 ``lowpoly`` 子資料夾，高多邊形則在 "
