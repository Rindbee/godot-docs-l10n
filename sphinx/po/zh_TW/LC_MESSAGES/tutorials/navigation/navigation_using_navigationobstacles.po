"2D and 3D versions of NavigationObstacles nodes are available as :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle2D<class_NavigationObstacle2D>` and :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle3D<class_NavigationObstacle3D>`  respectively."
msgstr ""
"2D 和 3D 版本的 NavigationObstacles 節點分別可用作:ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle2D<class_NavigationObstacle2D>` 和:ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle3D<class_NavigationObstacle3D>`。"

msgid ""
"When used statically NavigationObstacles constrain avoidance controlled "
"agents outside or inside a polygon defined area."
msgstr "當靜態使用時，導覽障礙會限制多邊形定義區域外部或內部的迴避控制代理。"

msgid ""
"When used dynamically NavigationObstacles push away avoidance controlled "
"agents in a radius around them."
msgstr "當動態使用時，導覽障礙會推開其周圍半徑範圍內的迴避控制代理。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles act as hard do-not-cross boundaries for avoidance using "
"agents, e.g. similar to physics collision but for avoidance."
msgstr ""
"靜態障礙物充當硬性請勿跨越邊界，以使用代理進行迴避，例如類似於物理碰撞，但用"
"於迴避。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles define their boundaries with an array of outline "
"``vertices`` (positions), and in case of 3D with an additional ``height`` "
"property."
msgstr ""
"靜態障礙物使用一系列輪廓「頂點」（位置）定義其邊界，如果是 3D，則具有附加的"
"「高度」屬性。"

msgid "Static obstacles only work for agents that use the 2D avoidance mode."
msgstr "靜態障礙物僅適用於使用 2D 迴避模式的代理。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles define through winding order of the vertices if agents are "
"pushed out or sucked in."
msgstr "如果代理人被推出或吸入，靜態障礙物透過頂點的纏繞順序來定義。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles that are warped to another position can not be predicted by "
"agents. This creates the risk of getting agents stuck should a static "
"obstacle be warped on top of agents."
msgstr ""
"代理無法預測扭曲到另一個位置的靜態障礙物。如果靜態障礙物扭曲到代理頂部，這就"
"會產生代理被卡住的風險。"

msgid ""
"When the 2D avoidance is used in 3D the y-axis of Vector3 vertices is "
"ignored. Instead, the global y-axis position of the obstacle is used as the "
"elevation level. Agents will ignore static obstacles in 3D that are below or "
"above them. This is automatically determined by global y-axis position of "
"both obstacle and agent as the elevation level as well as their respective "
"height properties."
msgstr ""
"當在 3D 中使用 2D 迴避時，Vector3 頂點的 y 軸將被忽略。相反，障礙物的全局 y "
"軸位置用作海拔高度。代理將忽略 3D 中低於或高於其的靜態障礙物。這是由障礙物和"
"代理的全局 y 軸位置自動確定為海拔高度以及它們各自的高度屬性。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles act as a soft please-move-away-from-me object for "
"avoidance using agents, e.g. similar to how they avoid other agents."
msgstr ""
"對於啟用了避障的代理而言，動態障礙物就是一個“請離我遠點”的物件，類似於它們自"
"己躲避其他代理的行為。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles define their boundaries with a single ``radius`` for a 2D "
"circle, or in case of 3D avoidance a sphere shape."
msgstr "動態障礙物使用 ``radius`` 半徑來定義邊界，2D 中是圓形，3D 中是球形。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles can change their position every frame without additional "
"performance cost."
msgstr "動態障礙物每一影格都可以改變位置，不會有額外的性能開銷。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles with a set velocity can be predicted in their movement by "
"agents."
msgstr "動態障礙物設定速度後，其他代理就能夠預測移動。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles are not a reliable way to constrain agents in crowded or "
"narrow spaces."
msgstr "動態障礙物不適合用來將代理限制在擁擠、狹窄的空間中。"

msgid ""
"Similar to agents the obstacles can make use of the ``avoidance_layers`` "
"bitmask. All agents with a matching bit on their own avoidance mask will "
"avoid the obstacle."
msgstr ""
"和代理類似，障礙物也能夠使用 ``avoidance_layers`` 位元遮罩。自身的避障遮罩中"
"與之存在配對位元的代理都會躲避這個障礙物。"

msgid ""
"Obstacles created with scripts require at least a ``map`` and a "
"``position``. For dynamic use a ``radius`` is required. For static use an "
"array of ``vertices`` is required."
msgstr ""
"使用腳本建立的障礙物至少需要有一個 ``map`` 和一個 ``position``。動態障礙物還"
"需要 ``radius``。靜態障礙物還需要 ``vertices`` 屬性。"
