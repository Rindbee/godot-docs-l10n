"An obstacle does not add geometry in the baking process, it only removes "
"geometry. It does so by nullifying all the (voxel) cells with rasterized "
"source geometry that are within the obstacle shape. As such its effect and "

msgstr ""
"障礙物在烘焙過程中不會新增幾何體，只會移除幾何體。它會將障礙物形狀範圍內的所"

"The ``carve_navigation_mesh`` property makes the shape unaffected by offsets "

msgstr ""

"The obstacle shape and placement is defined with the ``height`` and "

msgid ""
"Static obstacles define through winding order of the vertices if agents are "
"pushed out or sucked in."
msgstr "靜態障礙物會依頂點的繞行順序決定代理是被推出還是被吸入障礙物內部。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles can not change their position. They can only be warped to a "
"new position and rebuilt from scratch. Static obstacles as a result are ill-"
"suited for usages where the position is changed every frame, as the constant "
"rebuild has a high performance cost."
msgstr ""
"靜態障礙物無法直接改變位置，只能將其瞬移（warp）到新位置並重新建立，因此不適"
"合每幀都要移動位置的用途，否則會有很高的效能開銷。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles that are warped to another position can not be predicted by "
"agents. This creates the risk of getting agents stuck should a static "
"obstacle be warped on top of agents."
msgstr ""
"被瞬移到其他位置的靜態障礙物無法被代理預測。若靜態障礙物瞬移到代理上方，就有"
"可能讓代理被卡住。"

msgid ""
"When the 2D avoidance is used in 3D the y-axis of Vector3 vertices is "
"ignored. Instead, the global y-axis position of the obstacle is used as the "
"elevation level. Agents will ignore static obstacles in 3D that are below or "
"above them. This is automatically determined by global y-axis position of "
"both obstacle and agent as the elevation level as well as their respective "
"height properties."
msgstr ""
"當在 3D 場景下使用 2D 避障時，Vector3 頂點的 y 軸會被忽略，會以障礙物的全域 "

"根據障礙物與代理的全域 y 軸位置與各自的高度屬性自動判斷。"

msgid "Dynamic avoidance obstacles"
msgstr "動態避障障礙物"

msgid ""

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles are not a reliable way to constrain agents in crowded or "
"narrow spaces."
msgstr "動態障礙物並不適合用來在擁擠或狹窄空間中限制代理的行動。"

msgid ""
"While both static and dynamic properties can be active at the same time on "
"the same obstacle this is not recommended for performance. Ideally when an "
"obstacle is moving the static vertices are removed and instead the radius "
"activated. When the obstacle reaches the new final position it should "
"gradually enlarge its radius to push all other agents away. With enough "
"created safe space around the obstacle it should add the static vertices "
"again and remove the radius. This helps avoid getting agents stuck in the "
"suddenly appearing static obstacle when the rebuilt static boundary is "
"finished."
msgstr ""
"同一個障礙物可以同時啟用靜態與動態屬性，但基於效能考量並不建議這麼做。理想作"
"法是在障礙物移動時移除靜態頂點、啟用半徑；到達新位置後，逐漸擴大半徑以推開其"
"他代理，確保周圍有足夠安全空間，再新增回靜態頂點並移除半徑。這樣可避免代理因"
"障礙物靜態邊界突然出現而被卡住。"

msgid ""
"Similar to agents the obstacles can make use of the ``avoidance_layers`` "
"bitmask. All agents with a matching bit on their own avoidance mask will "
"avoid the obstacle."
msgstr ""
"與代理一樣，障礙物也能使用 ``avoidance_layers`` 位元遮罩。只要代理的避障遮罩"

msgid ""
"New obstacles can be created in a script without a Node by using the "
"NavigationServer directly."
msgstr "可以直接透過 NavigationServer 在腳本中建立障礙物，而不需依賴節點。"
