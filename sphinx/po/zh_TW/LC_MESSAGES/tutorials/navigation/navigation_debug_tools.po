msgid ""
"The debug tools, properties and functions are only available in Godot debug "
"builds. Do not use any of them in code that will be part of a release build."
msgstr ""
"除錯工具、屬性與函式僅在 Godot 除錯版本中可用。請勿在正式發行版本的程式碼中使"
"用這些功能。"

msgid "Enabling navigation debug"
msgstr "啟用導航除錯"

msgid ""
"The navigation debug visualizations are enabled by default inside the "
"editor. To visualize navigation meshes and connections at runtime too, "
"enable the option **Visible Navigation** in the editor **Debug** menu."
msgstr ""
"編輯器內預設啟用導航除錯視覺化。若要在執行時也顯示導航網格與連線，請在編輯器"
"的 **除錯** 選單中啟用 **顯示導航** 選項。"

msgid ""
"In Godot debug builds the navigation debug can also be toggled through the "
"NavigationServer singletons from scripts."
msgstr ""
"在 Godot 除錯版本中，也可以透過腳本使用 NavigationServer 單例來切換導航除錯。"

msgid ""
"Debug visualizations are currently based on Nodes in the SceneTree. If "
"the :ref:`NavigationServer2D<class_NavigationServer2D>` "
"or :ref:`NavigationServer3D<class_NavigationServer3D>` APIs are used "
"exclusively then changes will not be reflected by the debug navigation tools."
msgstr ""
"目前的導航除錯視覺化是依據場景樹中的節點（Node）。如果僅透"
"過 :ref:`NavigationServer2D<class_NavigationServer2D>` "
"或 :ref:`NavigationServer3D<class_NavigationServer3D>` API 來操作，則這些變更"
"不會反映在導航除錯工具中。"

msgid "Navigation debug settings"
msgstr "導航除錯設定"

msgid ""
"The appearance of navigation debug can be changed in the ProjectSettings "
"under ``debug/shapes/navigation``. Certain debug features can also be "
"enabled or disabled at will but may require a scene restart to take effect."
msgstr ""
"導航除錯的外觀可在專案設定（ProjectSettings）中的 ``debug/shapes/"
"navigation`` 進行調整。部分除錯功能可隨時開啟或關閉，但可能需重啟場景後才會生"
"效。"

msgid "Debug navigation mesh polygons"
msgstr "導航網格多邊形除錯"

msgid ""
"If ``enable_edge_lines`` is enabled, the edges of navigation mesh polygons "
"will be highlighted. If ``enable_edge_lines_xray`` is also enabled, the "
"edges of navigation meshes will be visible through geometry."
msgstr ""
"若啟用 ``enable_edge_lines``，導航網格多邊形的邊緣會被高亮顯示。若同時啟用 "
"``enable_edge_lines_xray``，則這些邊緣即使被其他幾何物件遮擋時也會顯示。"

msgid ""
"If ``enable_geometry_face_random_color`` is enabled, the color of each "
"navigation mesh face will be mixed with a random color that is itself mixed "
"with the color specified in ``geometry_face_color``."
msgstr ""
"若啟用 ``enable_geometry_face_random_color``，每個導航網格面將與 "
"``geometry_face_color`` 所指定的顏色混合隨機色彩。"

msgid "Debug edge connections"
msgstr "邊緣連線除錯"

msgid ""
"When two navigation meshes are connected within ``edge_connection_margin`` "
"distance, the connection is overlaid. The color of the overlay is controlled "
"by ``edge_connection_color``. The connections can be made visible through "
"geometry with ``enable_edge_connections_xray``."
msgstr ""
"當兩個導航網格在 ``edge_connection_margin`` 距離內連接時，會以覆蓋方式顯示連"
"線。覆蓋顏色由 ``edge_connection_color`` 控制。可藉由啟用 "
"``enable_edge_connections_xray`` 使連線在幾何物件後方也可見。"

msgid "Edge connections are only visible when the NavigationServer is active."
msgstr "僅當 NavigationServer 處於啟用狀態時，邊緣連線才會顯示。"

msgid "Debug performance"
msgstr "效能除錯"

msgid ""
"To measure NavigationServer performance a dedicated monitor exists that can "
"be found within the Editor Debugger under *Debugger->Monitors->Navigation "
"Process*."
msgstr ""
"要檢視 NavigationServer 的效能，可透過編輯器除錯器中的 *除錯器->監視器->導航"
"處理* 找到專屬監控項目。"

msgid ""
"Navigation Process shows how long the NavigationServer spends updating its "
"internals this update frame in milliseconds. Navigation Process works "
"similar to Process for visual frame rendering and Physics Process for "
"collision and fixed updates."
msgstr ""
"「導航處理」顯示 NavigationServer 在這個更新影格中花費多少毫秒進行內部更新。"
"其運作方式類似於處理（Process）用於視覺影格算繪，以及物理處理（Physics "
"Process）用於碰撞與固定更新。"

msgid ""
"Navigation Process accounts for all updates to **navigation maps**, "
"**navigation regions** and **navigation agents** as well as all the "
"**avoidance calculations** for the update frame."
msgstr ""
"導航處理包括對所有「導航地圖」、「導航區域」與「導航代理」的更新，以及本更新"
"影格的所有「避障計算」。"

msgid ""
"Navigation Process does NOT include pathfinding performance cause "
"pathfinding operates on the navigation map data independently from the "
"server process update."
msgstr ""
"導航處理（Navigation Process）**不**包含尋路（pathfinding）的效能，因為尋路作"
"業會獨立於伺服器處理程序，在導航地圖資料上進行。"

msgid ""
"Navigation Process should be in general kept as low and as stable as "
"possible for runtime performance to avoid frame rate issues. Note that since "
"the NavigationServer process update happens in the middle of the physics "
"update an increase in Navigation Process will automatically increase Physics "
"Process by the same amount."
msgstr ""
"導航處理應盡量保持低且穩定，以避免執行時的效能問題，如影格率下降。請注意，由"
"於 NavigationServer 的處理更新發生在物理更新中間，導航處理增加時也會同步增加"
"物理處理（Physics Process）所耗費的時間。"

msgid ""
"Navigation also provides more detailed statistics about the current "
"navigation related objects and navigation map composition on the "
"NavigationServer."
msgstr ""
"導航系統同時也會在 NavigationServer 上，提供目前導航相關物件與導航地圖組成的"
"更詳細統計數據。"

msgid ""
"Navigation statistics shown here can not be judged as good or bad for "
"performance as it depends entirely on the project what can be considered as "
"reasonable or horribly excessive."
msgstr ""
"此處顯示的導航統計資料無法單純判斷效能好壞，因為合理或過度的標準，完全依賴各"
"自的專案需求而定。"

msgid ""
"Navigation statistics help with identifying performance bottlenecks that are "
"less obvious because the source might not always have a visible "
"representation. E.g. pathfinding performance issues created by overly "
"detailed navigation meshes with thousand of edges / polygons or problems "
"caused by procedural navigation gone wrong."
msgstr ""
"導航統計資訊有助於找出那些不易察覺的效能瓶頸，因為問題來源未必有明顯表現。例"
"如：由數千邊或多邊形組成的過度複雜導航網格導致的尋路效能問題，或是程序化導航"
"失誤產生的問題。"
