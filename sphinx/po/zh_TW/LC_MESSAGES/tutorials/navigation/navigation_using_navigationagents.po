msgid "NavigationAgent Pathfinding"
msgstr "NavigationAgent 尋路"

msgid ""
"NavigationAgents query a new navigation path on their current navigation map "

msgstr ""
"當 NavigationAgent 的 ``target_position`` 設定為全域座標時，會在目前的導航地"
"圖上查詢新的路徑。"

msgid ""
"The result of the pathfinding can be influenced with the following "
"properties."
msgstr "尋路結果可由下列屬性影響。"

msgid ""
"The ``navigation_layers`` bitmask can be used to limit the navigation meshes "
"that the agent can use."
msgstr "``navigation_layers`` 位元遮罩可用來限制代理體可使用的導航網格。"

msgid ""
"The ``pathfinding_algorithm`` controls how the pathfinding travels through "
"the navigation mesh polygons in the path search."
msgstr "``pathfinding_algorithm`` 控制尋路演算法在導航網格多邊形中的搜尋方式。"

msgid ""

"the pathfinding is altered before it is returned."
msgstr ""
"``path_postprocessing`` 設定是否、以及如何對尋路找到的原始路徑走廊進行後處"
"理。"

msgid ""
"The ``path_metadata_flags`` enable the collection of additional path point "

msgstr "NavigationAgent 路徑跟隨"

msgid ""
"After a ``target_position`` has been set for the agent, the next position to "

msgstr ""
"當代理體設定了 ``target_position`` 後，可透過 ``get_next_path_position()`` 取"

msgid ""
"The navigation system never moves the parent node of a NavigationAgent. The "
"movement is entirely in the hands of users and their custom scripts."
msgstr ""
"導航系統不會自動移動 NavigationAgent 的父節點。移動完全由使用者自訂腳本控制。"

msgid ""
"NavigationAgents have their own internal logic to proceed with the current "
"path and call for updates."
msgstr "NavigationAgent 內部會處理自身的路徑狀態與更新流程。"

msgid ""
"The ``get_next_path_position()`` function is responsible for updating many "
"of the agent's internal states and properties. The function should be "
"repeatedly called *once* every ``physics_process`` until "
"``is_navigation_finished()`` tells that the path is finished. The function "
"should not be called after the target position or path end has been reached "
"as it can make the agent jitter in place due to the repeated path updates. "
"Always check very early in script with ``is_navigation_finished()`` if the "
"path is already finished."
msgstr ""
"``get_next_path_position()`` 函式會更新代理體多項內部狀態與屬性。此函式應於每"
"次 ``_physics_process`` 只呼叫一次，直到 ``is_navigation_finished()`` 回報路"
"徑已完成。若已抵達目標點或路徑終點，請勿再呼叫本函式，否則代理體會因持續更新"
"路徑而在原地抖動。建議在腳本中儘早以 ``is_navigation_finished()`` 檢查路徑是"
"否已結束。"

msgid ""
"The following distance properties influence the path following behavior."
msgstr "以下距離屬性會影響路徑跟隨行為。"

msgid ""
"At ``path_desired_distance`` from the next path position, the agent advances "

msgstr ""
"當代理體與下一個路徑點的距離小於 ``path_desired_distance`` 時，代理體會將內部"
"路徑索引推進到下個路徑點。"

msgid ""
"At ``target_desired_distance`` from the target path position, the agent "
"considers the target position to be reached and the path at its end."
msgstr ""
"當代理體與目標路徑點的距離小於 ``target_desired_distance`` 時，代理體會判定已"
"抵達目標點並結束路徑。"

msgid ""
"At ``path_max_distance`` from the ideal path to the next path position, the "
"agent requests a new path because it was pushed too far off."
msgstr ""
"當代理體偏離理想路徑到下一個路徑點的距離大於 ``path_max_distance`` 時，會重新"
"請求尋路，因為代理體已經太遠離原路徑。"

msgid ""
"The important updates are all triggered with the "
"``get_next_path_position()`` function when called in ``_physics_process()``."
msgstr ""
"上述重要更新皆會於 ``_physics_process()`` 內呼叫 "

"一次更新。"

msgid ""
"Script examples for various nodes commonly used with NavigationAgents can be "
"found further below."
msgstr "下方將提供常與 NavigationAgent 搭配使用的各類節點之腳本範例。"

msgid "Pathfollowing common problems"
msgstr "路徑跟隨常見問題"

msgid ""
"There are some common user problems and important caveats to consider when "
"writing agent movement scripts."
msgstr "編寫代理體移動腳本時，需注意下列常見問題與重要事項。"

msgid "The path is returned empty"
msgstr "取得的路徑為空"

msgid ""
"If an agent queries a path before the navigation map synchronisation, e.g. "
"in a ``_ready()`` function, the path might return empty. In this case the "
"``get_next_path_position()`` function will return the same position as the "
"agent parent node and the agent will consider the path end reached. This is "
"fixed by making a deferred call or using a callback e.g. waiting for the "
"navigation map changed signal."
msgstr ""
"如果在導航地圖尚未同步前（如於 ``_ready()`` 中）查詢路徑，可能會取得空路徑。"
"這時 ``get_next_path_position()`` 會回傳與代理體父節點相同的位置，並視為已到"
"達終點。解決方式為延遲呼叫，或等待導航地圖變更訊號後再查詢路徑。"

msgid "The agent is stuck dancing between two positions"
msgstr "代理體卡在兩個位置來回抖動"

msgid ""
"This is usually caused by very frequent path updates every single frame, "
"either deliberate or by accident (e.g. max path distance set too short). The "
"pathfinding needs to find the closest position that are valid on navigation "
"mesh. If a new path is requested every single frame the first path positions "
"might end up switching constantly in front and behind the agent's current "
"position, causing it to dance between the two positions."
msgstr ""
"這通常是因為每幀都在重新計算路徑（例如最大路徑距離設定過短）所致。尋路會尋找"
"離代理體最近且有效的導航網格位置，如果每一幀都重新尋路，第一個路徑點可能會在"
"代理體當前位置前後不斷切換，導致角色來回抖動。"

msgid "The agent is backtracking sometimes"
msgstr "代理體有時會倒退回頭"

msgid ""
"If an agent moves very fast it might overshoot the path_desired_distance "
"check without ever advancing the path index. This can lead to the agent "
"backtracking to the path point now behind it until it passes the distance "
"check to increase the path index. Increase the desired distances accordingly "
"for your agent speed and update rate usually fixes this as well as a more "
"balanced navigation mesh polygon layout with not too many polygon edges "
"cramped together in small spaces."
msgstr ""
"若代理體速度過快，可能會直接超過 ``path_desired_distance`` 而無法推進路徑索"
"引，導致代理體回頭走回上一個路徑點，直到通過距離判斷才往下個路徑點前進。請依"
"代理體速度與更新頻率適當調整距離設定，並優化導航網格多邊形佈局（避免小範圍內"
"擠太多邊）以改善此問題。"

msgid "The agent is sometimes looking backwards for a frame"
msgstr "代理體有時會瞬間朝反方向旋轉"

msgid ""
"Same as with stuck dancing agents between two positions, this is usually "
"caused by very frequent path updates every single frame. Depending on your "
"navigation mesh layout, and especially when an agent is directly placed over "
"a navigation mesh edge or edge connection, expect path positions to be "
"sometimes slightly \"behind\" your actors current orientation. This happens "
"due to precision issues and can not always be avoided. This is usually only "
"a visible problem if actors are instantly rotated to face the current path "
"position."
msgstr ""
"和上面代理體在兩點間抖動的情形一樣，這也多半是每幀過度更新路徑造成。根據導航"
"網格佈局，尤其當代理體剛好位於網格邊緣或連接點時，路徑點有時可能會落在角色當"
"下朝向的後方，此為精度誤差所致，不一定能完全避免。通常只有在角色瞬間朝向目前"
"路徑點時才會明顯出現該現象。"

msgid "NavigationAgent Avoidance"
msgstr "NavigationAgent 迴避"

msgid ""
"This section explains how to use the navigation avoidance specific to "
"NavigationAgents."
msgstr "本節介紹如何使用 NavigationAgent 的專屬導航迴避功能。"

msgid ""
"The ``velocity_computed`` signal of the NavigationAgent node must be "
"connected to receive the safe velocity calculation result."
msgstr ""
"必須連接 NavigationAgent 節點的 ``velocity_computed`` 訊號，才能取得安全速度"
"運算結果。"

msgid ""
"Set the ``velocity`` of the NavigationAgent node in ``_physics_process()`` "
"to update the agent with the current velocity of the agent's parent node."
msgstr ""
"請於 ``_physics_process()`` 內設定 NavigationAgent 節點的 ``velocity``，以更"
"新代理體的當前速度（通常為父節點的速度）。"

msgid ""
"While avoidance is enabled on the agent the ``safe_velocity`` vector will be "
"received with the velocity_computed signal every physics frame. This "
"velocity vector should be used to move the NavigationAgent's parent node in "
"order to avoidance collision with other avoidance using agents or avoidance "
"obstacles."
msgstr ""
"當代理體啟用迴避後，每個物理更新時會收到 ``velocity_computed`` 訊號與 "
"``safe_velocity`` 向量。請使用此向量移動 NavigationAgent 的父節點，以避開其他"
"代理體或迴避障礙物。"

msgid ""
"Only other agents on the same map that are registered for avoidance themself "
"will be considered in the avoidance calculation."
msgstr "只有同一張地圖上啟用迴避註冊的其他代理體，才會納入迴避運算考量。"

msgid "The following NavigationAgent properties are relevant for avoidance:"
msgstr "下列 NavigationAgent 屬性與迴避有關："

msgid ""
"The property ``height`` is available in 3D only. The height together with "
"the current global y-axis position of the agent determines the vertical "
"placement of the agent in the avoidance simulation. Agents using the 2D "
"avoidance will automatically ignore other agents or obstacles that are below "
"or above them."
msgstr ""
"``height`` 屬性僅供 3D 使用。高度結合代理體目前全域 y 軸位置，決定代理體在迴"
"避模擬中的垂直層級。使用 2D 迴避時，會自動忽略高於或低於自身的其他代理體或障"
"礙。"

msgid ""
"The property ``radius`` controls the size of the avoidance circle, or in "
"case of 3D sphere, around the agent. This area describes the agents body and "
"not the avoidance maneuver distance."
msgstr ""
"``radius`` 屬性設定代理體迴避圓的半徑（3D 為球體），代表代理體本身的碰撞體"
"積，而非迴避動作的距離。"

msgid ""
"The property ``neighbor_distance`` controls the search radius of the agent "
"when searching for other agents that should be avoided. A lower value "
"reduces processing cost."
msgstr ""
"``neighbor_distance`` 屬性設定代理體搜尋其他需迴避代理的半徑。數值越低，運算"
"成本越小。"

msgid ""
"The property ``max_neighbors`` controls how many other agents are considered "
"in the avoidance calculation if they all have overlapping radius. A lower "
"value reduces processing cost but a too low value may result in agents "
"ignoring the avoidance."
msgstr ""
"``max_neighbors`` 屬性控制迴避運算時最多考慮多少個重疊半徑的代理體。設太低雖"
"可減少運算，但可能導致部分代理體忽略迴避。"

msgid ""
"The properties ``time_horizon_agents`` and ``time_horizon_obstacles`` "
"control the avoidance prediction time for other agents or obstacles in "
"seconds. When agents calculate their safe velocities they choose velocities "
"that can be kept for this amount of seconds without colliding with another "
"avoidance object. The prediction time should be kept as low as possible as "
"agents will slow down their velocities to avoid collision in that timeframe."
msgstr ""
"``time_horizon_agents`` 及 ``time_horizon_obstacles`` 屬性設定預測其他代理體"
"／障礙物的避障時間（秒）。代理體會選擇在此時間內不會碰撞的安全速度。預測時間"
"建議盡量設低，否則代理體會提前減速以避免碰撞。"

msgid ""
"The property ``max_speed`` controls the maximum velocity allowed for the "
"agents avoidance calculation. If the agents parents moves faster than this "
"value the avoidance ``safe_velocity`` might not be accurate enough to avoid "
"collision."
msgstr ""
"``max_speed`` 屬性決定代理體避障運算時允許的最大速度。若父節點速度大於此值，"
"``safe_velocity`` 可能不足以避免碰撞。"

msgid ""
"The property ``use_3d_avoidance`` switches the agent between the 2D "
"avoidance (xz axis) and the 3D avoidance (xyz axis) on the next update. Note "
"that 2D avoidance and 3D avoidance run in separate avoidance simulations so "
"agents split between them do not affect each other."
msgstr ""
"``use_3d_avoidance`` 屬性可切換代理體在下次更新時使用 2D（XZ 軸）或 3D（XYZ "
"軸）避障。2D 與 3D 避障彼此獨立，互不影響。"

msgid ""
"The properties ``avoidance_layers`` and ``avoidance_mask`` are bitmasks "
"similar to e.g. physics layers. Agents will only avoid other avoidance "
"objects that are on an avoidance layer that matches at least one of their "
"own avoidance mask bits."
msgstr ""
"``avoidance_layers`` 與 ``avoidance_mask`` 屬性為位元遮罩，類似物理層。代理體"
"僅會避開與自身遮罩有交集的迴避層物件。"

msgid ""
"The ``avoidance_priority`` makes agents with a higher priority ignore agents "
"with a lower priority. This can be used to give certain agents more "
"importance in the avoidance simulation, e.g. important non-playable "
"characters, without constantly changing their entire avoidance layers or "
"mask."
msgstr ""
"``avoidance_priority`` 屬性讓高優先級代理體可忽略低優先級代理體。可用於讓特定"
"代理體（如重要 NPC）在避障計算中獲得更高權重，而無需更動其整體遮罩或層級。"

msgid ""
"Avoidance exists in its own space and has no information from navigation "
"meshes or physics collision. Behind the scene avoidance agents are just "
"circles with different radius on a flat 2D plane or spheres in an otherwise "
"empty 3D space. NavigationObstacles can be used to add some environment "
"constrains to the avoidance simulation, "
"see :ref:`doc_navigation_using_navigationobstacles`."
msgstr ""
"避障運算是在獨立空間進行，無法直接取得導航網格或物理碰撞資訊。實際上每個代理"
"體在避障系統中是平面圓形（2D）或球體（3D）。若需考慮環境限制，可使用 "
"NavigationObstacles，詳見 :ref:`doc_navigation_using_navigationobstacles`。"

msgid ""
"Avoidance does not affect the pathfinding. It should be seen as an "
"additional option for constantly moving objects that cannot be (re)baked to "
"a navigation mesh efficiently in order to move around them."
msgstr ""
"避障功能不會影響路徑尋找。它適合用於那些無法（重新）烘焙到導航網格上的持續移"
"動物件，以便讓代理體能繞行。"

msgid ""
"RVO avoidance makes implicit assumptions about natural agent behavior. E.g. "
"that agents move on reasonable passing sides that can be assigned when they "
"encounter each other. This means that very clinical avoidance test scenarios "
"will commonly fail. E.g. agents moved directly against each other with "
"perfect opposite velocities will fail because the agents can not get their "
"passing sides assigned."
msgstr ""
"RVO 避障法預設代理體會有自然的避讓行為，例如雙方相遇時會自動分流至左右。因此"
"極端測試情境常會失敗，例如代理體完全正面對衝且速度相反，會因無法分配避讓方向"
"而失效。"
