msgid "Min, max, and curve properties"
msgstr "最小值、最大值與曲線屬性"

msgid ""
"The properties in this material control how particles behave and change over "
"their lifetime. A lot of them have ``Min``, ``Max``, and ``Curve`` values "
"that allow you to fine-tune their behavior. The relationship between these "
"values is this: When a particle is spawned, the property is set with a "
"random value between ``Min`` and ``Max``. If ``Min`` and ``Max`` are the "
"same, the value will always be the same for every particle. If the ``Curve`` "
"is also set, the value of the property will be multiplied by the value of "
"the curve at the current point in a particle's lifetime. Use the curve to "
"change a property over the particle lifetime. Very complex behavior can be "
"expressed this way."
msgstr ""
"這個材質中的屬性會控制粒子在其生命週期中的行為與變化。許多屬性都包含 "
"``Min``、``Max`` 和 ``Curve`` 數值，讓你能夠細緻調整粒子的表現。這些值的關係"
"如下：每當產生一個粒子時，該屬性會設定為 ``Min`` 到 ``Max`` 之間的隨機值。如"
"果 ``Min`` 與 ``Max`` 相同，所有粒子的該屬性都會相同。如果同時設定了 "
"``Curve``，則該屬性的值會再乘上粒子生命週期當前點上曲線的值。你可以用曲線來讓"
"屬性隨粒子生命週期變化。這樣就能表達出非常複雜的行為。"

msgid "Lifetime Randomness"
msgstr "生命週期隨機性"

msgid ""
"The ``Lifetime Randomness`` property controls how much randomness to apply "
"to each particle's lifetime. A value of ``0`` means there is no randomness "
"at all and all particles live for the same amount of time, set by "
"the :ref:`Lifetime <doc_3d_particles_properties_time>` property. A value of "
"``1`` means that a particle's lifetime is completely random within the range "
"of [0.0, ``Lifetime``]."
msgstr ""
"``Lifetime Randomness``（生命週期隨機性）屬性用來控制每個粒子的壽命隨機程度。"
"值為 ``0`` 時，所有粒子的壽命都相同，由 :ref:`Lifetime "
"<doc_3d_particles_properties_time>` 屬性決定；值為 ``1`` 時，粒子的壽命會完全"
