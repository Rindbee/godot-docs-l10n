msgid "2D movement overview"
msgstr "2D 運動概述"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Every beginner has been there: \"How do I move my character?\" Depending on "
"the style of game you're making, you may have special requirements, but in "
"general the movement in most 2D games is based on a small number of designs."
msgstr ""
"每個初學者都曾遇過同樣的情況：「我要怎麼控制我的角色？」根據你想做的遊戲風"
"格，你可能會有特殊的需求。但普遍來說，大部分2D遊戲的操控是以少數幾種設計為基"
"礎的。"

msgid ""
"We'll use :ref:`CharacterBody2D <class_CharacterBody2D>` for these examples, "
"but the principles will apply to other node types (Area2D, RigidBody2D) as "
"well."
msgstr ""
"這裡我們用 :ref:`CharacterBody2D <class_CharacterBody2D>` 當作範例，不過其他"
"型別的節點（Area2D、RigidBody2D）也適用相同原則。"

msgid "Setup"
msgstr "設定"

msgid ""
"Each example below uses the same scene setup. Start with a "
"``CharacterBody2D`` with two children: ``Sprite2D`` and "
"``CollisionShape2D``. You can use the Godot icon (\"icon.png\") for the "
"Sprite2D's texture or use any other 2D image you have."
msgstr ""
"以下每個範例都使用相同的場景設定。請先建立一個 ``CharacterBody2D``，並加上兩"
"個子節點：``Sprite2D`` 和 ``CollisionShape2D``。你可以使用 Godot 預設圖示"
"（「icon.png」）作為 Sprite2D 的貼圖，或是用你自己的 2D 圖片。"

msgid ""
"Open ``Project -> Project Settings`` and select the \"Input Map\" tab. Add "
"the following input actions (see :ref:`InputEvent <doc_inputevent>` for "
"details):"
msgstr ""
"開啟「專案 -> 專案設定」，切換到「輸入對應」分頁。新增下列輸入動作（詳情請參"
"考 :ref:`InputEvent <doc_inputevent>`）："

msgid "8-way movement"
msgstr "八向移動"

msgid ""
"In this scenario, you want the user to press the four directional keys (up/"
"left/down/right or W/A/S/D) and move in the selected direction. The name \"8-"
"way movement\" comes from the fact that the player can move diagonally by "
"pressing two keys at the same time."
msgstr ""
"在這個情境中，你希望玩家可以按上下左右（或 W/A/S/D）來移動角色。所謂的「八向"
"移動」，就是因為玩家可以同時按下兩個方向鍵，讓角色斜向移動。"

msgid "Add a script to the character body and add the following code:"
msgstr "在角色節點新增腳本，填入下列程式碼："

msgid ""
"In the ``get_input()`` function, we use :ref:`Input <class_Input>` "
"``get_vector()`` to check for the four key events and sum return a direction "
"vector."
msgstr ""
"在 ``get_input()`` 函式中，我們用 :ref:`Input <class_Input>` 的 "
"``get_vector()`` 來檢查四個方向鍵，回傳一個方向向量。"

msgid ""
"We can then set our velocity by multiplying this direction vector, which has "
"a length of ``1``, by our desired speed."
msgstr "然後我們可以將這個長度為 1 的方向向量乘上我們想要的速度，來設定速度。"

msgid ""
"If you've never used vector math before, or need a refresher, you can see an "
"explanation of vector usage in Godot at :ref:`doc_vector_math`."
msgstr ""
"如果你沒學過向量數學或需要複習，可以參考 :ref:`doc_vector_math` 了解 Godot 裡"
"的向量用法。"

msgid ""
"If the code above does nothing when you press the keys, double-check that "
"you've set up input actions correctly as described in "
"the :ref:`doc_2d_movement_setup` part of this tutorial."
msgstr ""
"如果你按下按鍵時上述程式碼沒反應，請再次確認你是否按照本教"
"學 :ref:`doc_2d_movement_setup` 的說明正確設定了輸入動作。"

msgid "Rotation + movement"
msgstr "旋轉+移動"

msgid ""
"This type of movement is sometimes called \"Asteroids-style\" because it "
"resembles how that classic arcade game worked. Pressing left/right rotates "
"the character, while up/down moves it forward or backward in whatever "
"direction it's facing."
msgstr ""
"這種移動方式有時被稱為「Asteroids 風格」，因為這很像經典街機遊戲 Asteroids 的"
"移動方式。按左右鍵讓角色旋轉，按上下鍵則讓角色往面對的方向前進或後退。"

msgid ""
"Here we've added two variables to track our rotation direction and speed. "
"The rotation is applied directly to the body's ``rotation`` property."
msgstr ""
"在這裡我們新增了兩個變數來記錄旋轉方向和速度。旋轉會直接套用到角色的 "
"``rotation`` 屬性上。"

msgid ""
"To set the velocity, we use the body's ``transform.x`` which is a vector "
"pointing in the body's \"forward\" direction, and multiply that by the speed."
msgstr ""
"要設定速度，我們利用角色本身的 ``transform.x``，這是指向角色「前方」的向量，"
"然後乘上速度。"

msgid "Rotation + movement (mouse)"
msgstr "旋轉+移動（滑鼠）"

msgid ""
"This style of movement is a variation of the previous one. This time, the "
"direction is set by the mouse position instead of the keyboard. The "
"character will always \"look at\" the mouse pointer. The forward/back inputs "
"remain the same, however."
msgstr ""
"這種移動方式是前面 Asteroids 式的變體。這次方向是由滑鼠位置決定，角色會一直"
"「朝向」滑鼠游標。前進/後退的操作則不變。"

msgid ""
"Here we're using the :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` ``look_at()`` method to "
"point the player towards the mouse's position. Without this function, you "
"could get the same effect by setting the angle like this:"
msgstr ""
"這裡我們用 :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` 的 ``look_at()`` 方法讓角色朝向滑鼠游"
"標。如果不用這個方法，也可以直接這樣設定角度："

msgid "Click-and-move"
msgstr "點擊並移動"

msgid ""
"This last example uses only the mouse to control the character. Clicking on "
"the screen will cause the player to move to the target location."
msgstr "最後這個範例完全用滑鼠來控制角色。點擊畫面就會讓角色移動到指定位置。"

msgid ""
"Note the ``distance_to()`` check we make prior to movement. Without this "
"test, the body would \"jitter\" upon reaching the target position, as it "
"moves slightly past the position and tries to move back, only to move too "
"far and repeat."
msgstr ""
"請注意我們在移動前加上的 ``distance_to()`` 檢查。若沒有這一判斷，角色抵達目標"
"時會因為超過目標又回頭，造成一直來回「抖動」。"

msgid ""
"Uncommenting the ``look_at()`` line will also turn the body to point in its "
"direction of motion if you prefer."
msgstr "如果你想讓角色朝運動方向轉向，可以把 ``look_at()`` 那一行取消註解。"

msgid ""
"This technique can also be used as the basis of a \"following\" character. "
"The ``target`` position can be that of any object you want to move to."
msgstr ""
"這個技巧也可以當作「跟隨」角色的基礎，``target`` 目標位置可以是你想追蹤的任何"
"物件。"

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "總結"

msgid ""
"You may find these code samples useful as starting points for your own "
"projects. Feel free to use them and experiment with them to see what you can "
"make."
msgstr "這些範例程式碼非常適合當作你自己專案的起點，歡迎自由使用或改造。"
