"The PCK/ZIP files can even be an entirely different Godot project, which the "

msgstr ""
"PCK/ZIP 甚至可以是一個完全不同的 Godot 專案，供原本的遊戲在執行時載入。"

"It is possible to load both PCK and ZIP files as additional packs at the "

msgstr ""
"可以同時載入 PCK 與 ZIP 作為附加資源包。兩者差異請參"
"見 :ref:`doc_exporting_projects_pck_versus_zip`。"

msgid ""
"If you want to load loose files at runtime (not packed in a PCK or ZIP by "
"Godot), consider using :ref:`doc_runtime_loading_and_saving` instead. This "

msgstr ""
"若想在執行期載入散檔（非由 Godot 打包成 PCK 或 ZIP），可考慮使"

"The downside of this approach is that it's less transparent to the game "

"要將專案所有資源打包為 PCK，請開啟專案後前往 **Project > Export**，並點擊 "

"Another method would be to :ref:`export from the command line "
"<doc_command_line_tutorial_exporting>` with ``--export-pack``. The output "
"file must with a ``.pck`` or ``.zip`` file extension. The export process "
"will build that type of file for the chosen platform."
msgstr ""
"另一種方式是使用命令列以 ``--export-pack`` :ref:`進行匯出 "
"<doc_command_line_tutorial_exporting>`。輸出檔案的副檔名必須是 ``.pck`` 或 "
"``.zip``。匯出流程會為所選平台建立該類型的檔案。"

msgid ""
"If one wishes to support mods for their game, they will need their users to "

"certain structure for the PCK's resources and/or a certain interface for its "
"scripts, then either..."
msgstr ""
"如欲於遊戲中支援 Mod，則必須讓使用者能建立類似的匯出檔案。假設原始遊戲需要特"
"定結構的 PCK 資源，或是需要腳本有特定的介面，那麼可選擇下列其中一種方法..."

msgid ""
"The developer must publicize documentation of these expected structures/ "
"interfaces, expect modders to install Godot Engine, and then also expect "
"those modders to conform to the documentation's defined API when building "
"mod content for the game (so that it will work). Users would then use "
"Godot's built in exporting tools to create a PCK file, as detailed above."
msgstr ""
"開發人員必須公開所需架構／介面的文件，並讓 Mod 作者安裝 Godot Engine，接著要"
"求 Mod 作者依照文件中定義的 API 來製作 Mod (這樣才能正常運作)。使用者接著便能"
"以上述方法通過 Godot 內建匯出工具來製作 PCK 檔案。"

msgid ""
"The developer uses Godot to build a GUI tool for adding their exact API "
"content to a project. This Godot tool must either run on a tools-enabled "
"build of the engine or have access to one (distributed alongside or perhaps "
"in the original game's files). The tool can then use the Godot executable to "
"export a PCK file from the command line with :ref:`OS.execute() "
"<class_OS_method_execute>`. The game itself shouldn't use a tool-build of "
"the engine (for security), so it's best to keep the modding tool and game "
"separate."
msgstr ""
"開發人員使用 Godot 來製作使用專案 API 的 GUI 工具。該 Godot 工具必須執行於有"
"啟用工具功能的引擎建置，或是能存取工具功能的引擎建置 (與原始遊戲檔案一起發"
"佈，或在遊戲檔案內發行)。該工具接著可使用 Godot 的執行檔來在命令列中"
"以 :ref:`OS.execute() <class_OS_method_execute>` 來匯出 PCK 檔。對大多數遊戲"
"來說，都不適合在遊戲中使用工具建置 (安全性考量)，而 Mod 工具則 **要** 啟用工"
"具建置。"

msgid "Opening PCK or ZIP files at runtime"
msgstr "在執行期開啟 PCK 或 ZIP 檔"

msgid ""
"To load a PCK or ZIP file, one uses the ProjectSettings singleton. The "
"following example expects a ``mod.pck`` file in the directory of the game's "
"executable. The PCK or ZIP file contains a ``mod_scene.tscn`` test scene in "
"its root."
msgstr ""
"要載入 PCK 或 ZIP 檔，請使用 ProjectSettings 單例。以下範例假設遊戲執行檔所在"
"資料夾有一個 ``mod.pck``，且該 PCK/ZIP 的根目錄包含測試場景 "
"``mod_scene.tscn``。"

msgid ""
"By default, if you import a file with the same file path/name as one you "
"already have in your project, the imported one will replace it. This is "
"something to watch out for when creating DLC or mods. You can solve this "
"problem by using a tool that isolates mods to a specific mods subfolder."
msgstr ""
"預設情況下，若匯入的檔案與專案內既有檔案的路徑／名稱相同，新的檔案會取代舊"
"檔。製作 DLC 或模組時須特別注意。你可以使用工具將模組隔離在特定的 mods 子資料"
"夾以解決此問題。"

msgid ""
"However, it is also a way of creating patches for one's own game. A PCK/ZIP "
"file of this kind can fix the content of a previously loaded PCK/ZIP "
"(therefore, the order in which packs are loaded matters)."
msgstr ""
"不過，這同時也可用於為自己的遊戲建立修補檔。此類 PCK/ZIP 能覆蓋先前載入的 "
"PCK/ZIP 內容（因此載入順序很重要）。"

msgid ""
"To opt out of this behavior, pass ``false`` as the second argument "
"to :ref:`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>`."
msgstr ""
"若要取消此一行為，請向 :ref:`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>` 傳入第二個參數為 "
"``false`` 。"

msgid ""
"For a C# project, you need to build the DLL and place it in the project "
"directory first. Then, before loading the resource pack, you need to load "
"its DLL as follows: ``Assembly.LoadFile(\"mod.dll\")``"
msgstr ""
"C# 專案，則需要先建置 DLL 並放在專案資料夾中。接著，在載入資源包前必須先這樣"
"載入 DLL： ``Assembly.LoadFile(\"mod.dll\")``"

msgid "Troubleshooting"
msgstr "疑難排解"

msgid ""
"If you are loading a resource pack and are not noticing any changes, it may "
"be due to the pack being loaded too late. This is particularly the case with "
"menu scenes that may preload other scenes using :ref:`preload() "
"<class_@GDScript_method_preload>`. This means that loading a pack in the "
"menu will not affect the other scene that was already preloaded."
msgstr ""
"若載入資源包後沒有看到變化，可能是載入時機太晚。特別是選單場景可能使"
"用 :ref:`preload() <class_@GDScript_method_preload>` 預先載入其他場景，此時在"
"選單中才載入的資源包不會影響已被預載的場景。"

msgid ""
"To avoid this, you need to load the pack as early as possible. To do so, "
"create a new :ref:`autoload <doc_singletons_autoload>` script and "
"call :ref:`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>` in the autoload script's "
"``_init()`` function, rather than ``_enter_tree()`` or ``_ready()``."
msgstr ""
"為避免此情況，請盡可能提早載入資源包。作法是建立新的 :ref:`autoload "
"<doc_singletons_autoload>` 腳本，並在其 ``_init()`` 中呼"
"叫 :ref:`ProjectSettings.load_resource_pack() "
"<class_ProjectSettings_method_load_resource_pack>`，而非在 ``_enter_tree()`` "
"或 ``_ready()``。"

msgid "Summary"
msgstr "總結"

msgid ""
"This tutorial explains how to add mods, patches, or DLC to a game. The most "
"important thing is to identify how one plans to distribute future content "
"for their game and develop a workflow that is customized for that purpose. "
"Godot should make that process smooth regardless of which route a developer "
"pursues."
msgstr ""
"本教學說明了如何簡單地給遊戲加上 Mode、修正檔與 DLC。最重要的是該如何計劃發行"
"遊戲未來的內容，以及為此開發一個自定工作流程。Godot 依據開發人員選擇的方法，"
"確保該流程順暢。"
