msgstr "什麼是一鍵式部署？"

msgid ""
"One-click deploy is a feature that is available once a platform is properly "
"configured and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since things "
"can go wrong at many levels (platform may not be configured correctly, SDK "
"may be incorrectly installed, device may be improperly configured, etc.), "
"it's good to let the user know that it exists."
msgstr ""
"這個功能會在有正確配置平台且將支援的裝置連接到電腦上後彈出。由於很多地方都有"
"可能出問題 (平台可能未正確設定、可能沒正確安裝 SDK、裝置可能為正確設定…等)，"
"所以讓使用者知道有單鍵部署這功能存在也不錯。"

"After adding an Android export preset marked as Runnable, Godot can detect "
"when a USB device is connected to the computer and offer the user to "
"automatically export, install and run the project (in debug mode) on the "
"device. This feature is called *one-click deploy*."
msgstr ""
"有些平台 (在本文撰寫時，只有 Android) 可以在 USB 裝置連接到電腦上時自動偵測，"
"並提供使用者在該裝置上自動匯出、安裝與 (以除錯模式) 執行專案的功能，用業界的"
"流行語來說，就是「單鍵部署」。"

msgid ""
"One-click deploy is only available once you've added an export template "
"marked as **Runnable** in the Export dialog. You can mark several export "
"presets as runnable, but only one preset per platform may be marked as "
"runnable. If you mark a second preset in a given platform as runnable, the "
"other preset will no longer be marked as runnable."
msgstr ""
"在匯出對話方塊中新增匯出範本並標記為**可執行**後便可使用一鍵部署。你可以同時"
"將多個匯出預設項標記為可執行，但同一平臺被標記為可執行的只能有一個。如果你把"
"該平臺的第二個預設項標記為可執行，其它預設項的標記會被取消。"

"By default, the web server started by the editor is only accessible from "

"by accessing your router's web interface then adding a NAT rule for the port "
