"In order to develop for consoles in Godot, you need access to the console "
"SDK and export templates for it. These export templates need to be developed "
"either by yourself or someone hired to do it, or provided by a third-party "
"company."
msgstr ""
"若要在 Godot 中開發主機遊戲，必須取得該主機的 SDK 及其匯出範本。這些匯出範本"
"必須由你自行製作、委託他人開發，或由第三方公司提供。"

msgid ""
"Currently, the only console Godot officially supports is Steam Deck (through "
"the official Linux export templates)."
msgstr ""
"目前，Godot 官方唯一支援的主機是 Steam Deck（透過官方 Linux 匯出範本）。"

msgid ""
"As explained, however, it is possible to port your games to consoles thanks "
"to services provided by third-party companies."
msgstr "如上所述，透過協力廠商公司提供的服務，你仍可將遊戲移植到主機平台。"

msgid ""
"In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine. In "
"other words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to distribute "
"console export templates without requiring the user to prove that they are a "
"licensed console developer."
msgstr ""
"實務上，此流程與 Unity、Unreal Engine 類似——你必須洽詢協力廠商進行移植。換言"
"之，法律上沒有任何引擎能在不驗證用戶為授權主機開發者的前提下，合法提供主機匯"
"出範本，否則將違反主機廠商的 NDA。"

msgid "Console publishing process"

msgid ""
"Regardless of the engine used to create the game, the process to publish a "
"game to a console platform is as follows:"
msgstr "無論你使用哪個引擎開發遊戲，將遊戲發行到主機平台的流程如下："

msgid ""
"Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then "
"sign NDAs and publishing contracts. This requires you to have a registered "
"legal entity."
msgstr ""
"在主機製造商的網站註冊開發者帳號，並簽署 NDA 及出版合約。這通常需要你擁有註冊"
"公司或法人資格。"

msgid ""
"Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. "
"This can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly "
"easier if an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is "
"generally known to be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not "
"guaranteed."
msgstr ""
"通過審核後，獲得發行平台的存取權限。這可能需時數月。如有知名發行商協助，流程"
"會顯著簡化。任天堂通常較樂於接受小型開發者，但這無法保證。"

msgid ""
"Get access to developer tools and order a console specially made for "
"developers (*devkit*). The cost of those devkits is confidential."
msgstr ""
"取得開發工具的存取權並訂購專為開發者設計的主機（*devkit*）。這些 devkit 的價"
"格屬於機密。"

msgid ""
"To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to "
"sell it in. For example, game ratings are handled by `ESRB <https://"
"www.esrb.org/>`__ in North America, and `PEGI <https://pegi.info/>`__ in "
"Europe. Indie developers can generally get a rating for cheaper compared to "
"more established developers."
msgstr ""
"遊戲要發行，必須先在目標地區完成分級。例如北美由 `ESRB <https://www.esrb.org/"
">`__ 負責，歐洲則由 `PEGI <https://pegi.info/>`__ 負責。獨立開發者取得分級的"
"費用通常較大型開發商便宜。"

msgid ""
"Due to the complexity of the process, many studios and developers prefer to "
"outsource console porting."
