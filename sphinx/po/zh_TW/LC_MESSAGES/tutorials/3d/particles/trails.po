"Godot provides several types of trails you can add to a particle system. "
"Before you can work with trails, you need to set up a couple of parameters "
"first. Create a new particle system and assign a process material :ref:`as "
"described before <doc_creating_3d_particle_system>`. In the ``Trails`` group "
"of the particle system, check the box next to ``Enabled`` and increase the "
"emission duration by setting ``Lifetime`` to something like ``0.8``. On the "
"process material, set ``Direction`` to ``(X=0,Y=1.0,Z=0)`` and ``Initial "
"Velocity`` to ``10.0`` for both ``Min`` and ``Max``."
msgstr ""
"Godot 提供多種可以加入到粒子系統中的軌跡類型。在使用軌跡之前，需先設定一些參"
"數。建立新的粒子系統並指定處理材質（:ref:`如前所述 "
"<doc_creating_3d_particle_system>`）。在粒子系統的 ``Trails`` 群組中，勾選 "
"``Enabled``，並將 ``Lifetime`` 設為如 ``0.8`` 來增加發射持續時間。於處理材質"
"中，將 ``Direction`` 設為 ``(X=0, Y=1.0, Z=0)``，而 ``Initial Velocity`` 的 "
"``Min`` 與 ``Max`` 皆設為 ``10.0``。"

"The simplest type of particle trail is the ribbon trail. Navigate to the "

"You have two options for the ribbon mesh ``Shape`` parameter. ``Cross`` "
"creates two perpendicular quads, making the particle trail a little more "
"three-dimensional. This really only makes sense if you don't draw the trails "
"in ``Particle Billboard`` mode and helps when looking at the particles from "
"different angles. The ``Flat`` option limits the mesh to a single quad and "
"works best with billboard particles."
msgstr ""
"帶狀網格的 ``Shape`` 參數有兩種選項：``Cross`` 會產生兩個互相垂直的四邊形，使"
"粒子軌跡更具立體感，這在不使用 ``Particle Billboard`` 模式時特別有用，便於從"
"不同角度觀察軌跡。``Flat`` 則僅使用單一四邊形，最適合搭配看板粒子（billboard "

"The ``Size`` parameter controls the trail's width. Use it to make trails "

msgstr "``Size`` 參數控制軌跡的寬度，可用於調整軌跡的寬窄。"

msgid ""
"``Sections``, ``Section Length`` and ``Section Segments`` all work together "
"to control how smooth the particle trail looks. When a particle trail does "
"not travel in a straight line, the more sections it has the smoother it "
"looks as it bends and swirls. ``Section Length`` controls the length of each "
"section. Multiply this value by the number of sections to know the trail's "
"total length."
msgstr ""
"``Sections``、``Section Length`` 和 ``Section Segments`` 這三個參數共同影響粒"
"子軌跡的平滑度。當粒子軌跡不是直線移動時，區段數越多，彎曲時看起來越平滑。"
"``Section Length`` 控制每個區段的長度，將此值乘以區段數即可得出軌跡總長度。"

msgid ""
"The ``Section Segments`` parameter further subdivides each section into "
"segments. It has no effect on the smoothness of the trail's sections, "
"though. Instead, it controls the smoothness of the particle trail's overall "
"shape. The ``Curve`` property defines this shape. Click the box next to "
"``Curve`` and assign or create a new curve. The trail will be shaped just "

"Depending on the complexity of the curve, the particle trail's shape will "
"not look very smooth when the number of sections is low. This is where the "
"``Section Segments`` property comes in. Increasing the amount of section "
"segments adds more vertices to the trail's sides so that it can follow the "
"curve more closely."
msgstr ""
"若曲線較為複雜、區段數量不足時，軌跡外型會顯得不夠平滑。此時可透過增加 "

"The ``Radius`` and ``Radial Steps`` properties are to tube trails what "

"``Sections`` and ``Section Length`` work the same for tube trails and ribbon "

"to change the length of each section and with it the total length of the "
