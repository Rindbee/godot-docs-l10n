msgstr "3D 粒子系統屬性"

msgid "Emitter properties"
msgstr "發射器屬性"

msgid ""
"The checkbox next to the ``Emitting`` property activates and deactivates the "
"particle system. Particles will only be processed and rendered if the box is "
"checked. You can set this property at runtime if you want to activate or "
"deactivate particle systems dynamically."
msgstr ""
"「Emitting」屬性旁的核取方塊可用來啟用或停用粒子系統。只有在勾選時，粒子系統"
"才會被處理與顯示。你也可以在執行時動態切換這個屬性，以便動態啟動或關閉粒子系"
"統。"

msgid ""
"The ``Amount`` property controls the maximum number of particles visible at "
"any given time. Increase the value to spawn more particles at the cost of "
"performance."
msgstr ""
"「Amount」屬性用來設定同時可見的最大粒子數。提高這個數值能產生更多粒子，但會"
"犧牲效能。"

msgid ""
"The ``Amount Ratio`` property is the ratio of particles compared to the "
"amount that will be emitted. If it's less than ``1.0``, the amount of "
"particles emitted through the lifetime will be the ``Amount`` * ``Amount "
"Ratio``. Changing this value while emitted doesn't affect already created "
"particles and doesn't cause the particle system to restart. It's useful for "
"making effects where the number of emitted particles varies over time."
msgstr ""
"「Amount Ratio」屬性用來設定實際發射粒子的比例。如果小於 1.0，整個生命週期釋"
"放的粒子數會等於「Amount」乘以「Amount Ratio」。在粒子系統運作中修改這個值，"
"不會影響已經存在的粒子，也不會重啟粒子系統。這非常適合做粒子數量隨時間變化的"
"特效。"

msgid ""
"You can set another particle node as a ``Sub Emitter``, which will be "
"spawned as a child of each particle. See the :ref:`Sub-emitters "
"<doc_3d_particles_subemitters>` section in this manual for a detailed "
"explanation of how to add a sub-emitter to a particle system."
msgstr ""
"你可以將另一個粒子節點設為「Sub Emitter」，這個子發射器會在每個粒子的生命週期"
"中作為其子物件生成。詳細說明請參考本手冊中的 :ref:`子發射器 "
"<doc_3d_particles_subemitters>` 章節。"

msgid "Time properties"
msgstr "時間屬性"

msgid ""
"The ``Lifetime`` property controls how long each particle exists before it "
"disappears again. It is measured in seconds. A lot of particle properties "
"can be set to change over the particle's lifetime and blend smoothly from "
"one value to another."
msgstr ""
"「Lifetime」屬性設定每個粒子存在多久（以秒為單位），時間到就會消失。許多粒子"
"屬性都可以設定於粒子生命週期內平滑變化。"

msgid ""
"``Lifetime`` and ``Amount`` are related. They determine the particle "
"system's emission rate. Whenever you want to know how many particles are "
"spawned per second, this is the formula you would use:"
msgstr ""
"「Lifetime」和「Amount」兩個屬性相關聯，決定了粒子系統的發射速率。若要計算每"
"秒產生的粒子數，可使用以下公式："

msgid "Particles per second = \\frac{Amount}{Lifetime}"
msgstr "每秒粒子數 = \\frac{Amount}{Lifetime}"

msgid ""
"Example: Emitting 32 particles with a lifetime of 4 seconds each would mean "
"the system emits 8 particles per second."
msgstr ""
"例如：如果「Amount」為 32，「Lifetime」為 4 秒，代表系統每秒發射 8 個粒子。"

msgid ""
"The ``Interp to End`` property causes all the particles in the node to "
"interpolate towards the end of their lifetime."
msgstr ""
"「Interp to End」屬性會讓所有粒子在其生命週期結束時平滑插值到最終狀態。"

msgid ""
"If the checkbox next to the ``One Shot`` property is checked, the particle "
"system will emit ``amount`` particles and then disable itself. It \"runs\" "
"only once. This property is unchecked by default, so the system will keep "
"emitting particles until it is disabled or destroyed manually. One-shot "
"particles are a good fit for effects that react to a single event, like item "
"pickups or splinters that burst away when a bullet hits a wall."
msgstr ""
"如果勾選「One Shot」屬性，粒子系統將只發射一次（共「Amount」個粒子）後自動停"
"用。預設未勾選時，粒子系統會持續發射直到被手動停用或移除。「One Shot」很適合"
"用在單一事件觸發的特效，例如道具取得或子彈撞牆時飛散的碎片。"

msgid ""
"The ``Preprocess`` property is a way to fast-forward to a point in the "
"middle of the particle system's lifetime and start rendering from there. It "
"is measured in seconds. A value of ``1`` means that when the particle system "
"starts, it will look as if it has been running for one second already."
msgstr ""
"「Preprocess」屬性可以讓粒子系統在啟動時模擬已經運行了一段時間（以秒為單"
"位），直接渲染那個狀態。設為 1 代表系統啟動時，就像已經運作了一秒一樣。"

msgid ""
"This can be useful if you want the particle system to look like it has been "
"active for a while even though it was just loaded into the scene. Consider "
"the example below. Both particle systems simulate dust flying around in the "
"area. With a preprocess value of ``0``, there wouldn't be any dust for the "
"first couple of seconds because the system has not yet emitted enough "
"particles for the effect to become noticeable. This can be seen in the video "
"on the left. Compare that to the video on the right where the particle "
"system is preprocessed for ``4`` seconds. The dust is fully visible from the "
"very beginning because we skipped the first four seconds of \"setup\" time."
msgstr ""
"這很適合讓剛載入場景的粒子系統，看起來像已經運行了一段時間。比如下方範例，兩"
"個系統都模擬區域內飛舞的灰塵。若「Preprocess」設為 0，系統啟動前幾秒會看不到"
"灰塵，因為粒子還沒累積出效果。若設為 4，畫面一開始就會看到完全效果，因為跳過"
"了前 4 秒的「預備」時間。"

msgid "No preprocess (left) vs. 4 seconds of preprocess (right)"
msgstr "無預處理（左）vs. 預處理 4 秒（右）"

msgid ""
"You can slow down or speed up the particle system with the ``Speed Scale`` "
"property. This applies to processing the data as well as rendering the "
"particles. Set it to ``0`` to pause the particle system completely or set it "
"to something like ``2`` to make it move twice as fast."
msgstr ""
"你可以用「Speed Scale」屬性來調整粒子系統的快慢。這會影響粒子的運算與渲染速"
"度。設為 0 可完全暫停粒子系統，設為 2 則會讓系統加速一倍。"

msgid "Different speed scale values: 0.1 (left), 0.5 (middle), 1.0 (right)"
msgstr "不同的速度倍率：0.1（左）、0.5（中）、1.0（右）"

msgid ""
"The ``Explosiveness`` property controls whether particles are emitted "
"sequentially or simultaneously. A value of ``0`` means that particles emit "
"one after the other. A value of ``1`` means that all ``amount`` particles "
"emit at the same time, giving the effect a more \"explosive\" appearance."
msgstr ""
"「Explosiveness」屬性決定粒子是依序發射還是同時發射。設為 0 時粒子會一個接一"
"個發射，設為 1 時則會全部同時發射，呈現出更「爆炸」的效果。"

msgid ""
"The ``Randomness`` property adds some randomness to the particle emission "
"timing. When set to ``0``, there is no randomness at all and the interval "
"between the emission of one particle and the next is always the same: the "
"particles are emitted at *regular* intervals. A ``Randomness`` value of "
"``1`` makes the interval completely random. You can use this property to "
"break up some of the uniformity in your effects. When ``Explosiveness`` is "
"set to ``1``, this property has no effect."
msgstr ""
"「Randomness」屬性會讓粒子的發射時機帶有隨機性。設為 0 時，發射間隔完全固定，"
"粒子均勻出現。設為 1 時，間隔完全隨機，可以讓效果更自然。若「Explosiveness」"
"設為 1，此屬性則無作用。"

msgid "Particles running at low FPS"
msgstr "低 FPS 下執行的粒子效果"

msgid "Interpolation off (left) vs. on (right)"
msgstr "關閉插值（左）vs. 啟用插值（右）"

msgid ""
"The ``Fixed FPS`` property limits how often the particle system is "
"processed. This includes property updates as well as collision and "
"attractors. This can improve performance a lot, especially in scenes that "
"make heavy use of particle collision. Note that this does not change the "
"speed at which particles move or rotate. You would use the ``Speed Scale`` "
"property for that."
msgstr ""
"「Fixed FPS」屬性限制粒子系統更新的頻率，包含屬性、碰撞、吸引器等計算。這可以"
"大幅提升效能，特別是在有大量粒子碰撞時。注意這不會影響粒子的移動或旋轉速度，"
"若要調整速度請使用「Speed Scale」。"

msgid ""
"When you set ``Fixed FPS`` to very low values, you will notice that the "
"particle animation starts to look choppy. This can sometimes be desired if "
"it fits the art direction, but most of the time, you'll want particle "
"systems to animate smoothly. That's what the ``Interpolate`` property does. "
"It blends particle properties between updates so that even a particle system "
"running at ``10`` FPS appears as smooth as running at ``60``."
msgstr ""
"若將「Fixed FPS」設得太低，粒子的動畫會變得不流暢。某些美術風格可用這效果，但"
"大多數情況下你會希望動畫平滑。這時可啟用「Interpolate」屬性，在更新之間內插粒"
"子屬性，即使僅 10 FPS 也能呈現如 60 FPS 的流暢度。"

msgid ""
"When using :ref:`particle collision <doc_3d_particles_collision>`, tunneling "
"can occur if the particles move fast and colliders are thin. This can be "
"remedied by increasing ``Fixed FPS`` (at a performance cost)."
msgstr ""
"當使用 :ref:`粒子碰撞 <doc_3d_particles_collision>` 時，如果粒子速度很快且碰"
"撞體很薄，可能會發生穿透現象。這可透過提升「Fixed FPS」（會犧牲效能）來改善。"

msgid "Collision properties"
msgstr "碰撞屬性"

msgid ""
"Setting up particle collision requires following further steps described "
"in :ref:`doc_3d_particles_collision`."
msgstr ""
"設定粒子碰撞需要依照 :ref:`doc_3d_particles_collision` 章節的進階步驟操作。"

msgid ""
"The ``Base Size`` property defines each particle's default collision size, "
"which is used to check whether a particle is currently colliding with the "
"environment. You would usually want this to be about the same size as the "
"particle. It can make sense to increase this value for particles that are "
"very small and move very fast to prevent them from clipping through the "
"collision geometry."
msgstr ""
"「Base Size」屬性設定每個粒子的預設碰撞大小，用來檢查粒子是否與環境發生碰撞。"
"通常應設為與粒子本身差不多的大小。若粒子體積極小且速度很快，建議適度提高此"
"值，以避免粒子穿透碰撞體。"

msgid "Drawing properties"
msgstr "繪製屬性"

msgid "Particle drawing properties"
msgstr "粒子繪製屬性"

msgid ""
"The ``Visibility AABB`` property defines a box around the particle system's "
"origin. As long as any part of this box is in the camera's field of view, "
"the particle system is visible. As soon as it leaves the camera's field of "
"view, the particle system stops being rendered at all. You can use this "
"property to boost performance by keeping the box as small as possible."
msgstr ""
"「Visibility AABB」設定粒子系統原點周圍的可見方塊，只要方塊有任何部分在攝影機"
"畫面內，粒子系統就會被渲染。若完全離開畫面，則不再渲染。建議將方塊設得越小越"
"好，以提升效能。"

msgid ""
"One thing to keep in mind when you set a size for the ``Visibility AABB`` is "
"that particles that are outside of its bounds disappear instantly when it "
"leaves the camera's field of view. Particle collision will also not occur "
"outside the ``Visibility AABB``. While not technically a bug, this can have "
"a negative effect on the visual experience."
msgstr ""
"設定「Visibility AABB」時要注意，超出方塊邊界的粒子會立即消失，且該範圍外不會"
"發生粒子碰撞。雖然這不是 bug，但可能影響視覺效果。"

msgid ""
"When the ``Local Coords`` property is checked, all particle calculations use "
"the local coordinate system to determine things like up and down, gravity, "
"and movement direction. Up and down, for example, would follow the particle "
"system's or its parent node's rotation. When the property is unchecked, the "
"global world space is used for these calculations: Down will always be -Y in "
"world space, regardless of the particle system's rotation."
msgstr ""
"勾選「Local Coords」時，所有粒子的運算（重力、上下方向、移動方向等）都以本地"
"座標系統為準，例如上下會跟隨粒子系統或父節點的旋轉。若未勾選，則以全域世界座"
"標計算，無論粒子系統旋轉與否，下方永遠是世界空間的 -Y。"

msgid "Local space coordinates (left) vs. world space coordinates (right)"
msgstr "本地座標（左）與世界座標（右）"

msgid ""
"The ``Draw Order`` property controls the order in which individual particles "
"are drawn. ``Index`` means that they are drawn in the order of emission: "
"particles that are spawned later are drawn on top of earlier ones. "
"``Lifetime`` means that they are drawn in the order of their remaining "
"lifetime. ``Reverse Lifetime`` reverses the ``Lifetime`` draw order. ``View "
"Depth`` means particles are drawn according to their distance from the "
"camera: The ones closer to the camera on top of those farther away."
msgstr ""
"「Draw Order」屬性決定粒子的繪製順序。「Index」按發射順序繪製，後發射的粒子會"
"蓋在前一個之上。「Lifetime」則依剩餘壽命排序繪製。「Reverse Lifetime」則反轉"
"壽命順序。「View Depth」則依據與攝影機的距離，較近的粒子會蓋在較遠的上面。"

msgid ""
"The ``Transform Align`` property controls the particle's default rotation. "
"``Disabled`` means they don't align in any particular way. Instead, their "
"rotation is determined by the values set in the process material. ``Z-"
"Billboard`` means that the particles will always face the camera. This is "
"similar to the ``Billboard`` property in the :ref:`Standard Material "
"<doc_standard_material_3d>`. ``Y to Velocity`` means that each particle's Y-"
"axis aligns with its movement direction. This can be useful for things like "
"bullets or arrows, where you want particles to always point \"forward\". ``Z-"
"Billboard + Y to Velocity`` combines the previous two modes. Each particle's "
"Z-axis will point towards the camera while its Y-axis will align with their "
"velocity."
msgstr ""
"「Transform Align」屬性決定粒子的預設旋轉。「Disabled」表示不強制對齊，旋轉取"
"決於處理材質設定。「Z-Billboard」會讓粒子永遠面向攝影機，類似 :ref:`Standard "
"Material <doc_standard_material_3d>` 的「Billboard」屬性。「Y to Velocity」則"
"將每個粒子的 Y 軸對齊其移動方向，適合像子彈、箭矢這類必須朝前的效果。「Z-"
"Billboard + Y to Velocity」則會讓 Z 軸朝向攝影機，Y 軸同時對齊速度方向。"
