"Turbulence uses a noise texture to add variation and interesting patterns to "
"particle movement. It can be combined with :ref:`particle attractors "
"<doc_3d_particles_attractors>` and :ref:`collision "
"<doc_3d_particles_collision>` nodes to create even more complex looking "
"behavior."

"亂流利用雜訊貼圖，為粒子的移動添加變化與有趣的模式。你可以將其與 :ref:`粒子吸"
"引器 <doc_3d_particles_attractors>` 以及 :ref:`碰撞 "
"<doc_3d_particles_collision>` 節點結合，製作出更為複雜的動態效果。"

"There are two things you have to do before turbulence has any effect on a "
"particle system. First you must add movement to the particle system. "
"Turbulence modifies a particle's movement direction and speed, but it "
"doesn't create any. It is enough to give the particle system some gravity, "
"but you can just as well create a number of attractors if you want the "
"particles to follow a more complex movement path. Second, you need "
"to :ref:`enable turbulence in the particle process material "
"<doc_process_material_properties_turbulence>`. Once enabled, you have access "
"to all the turbulence properties."
msgstr ""
"要讓亂流對粒子系統產生作用，需要先完成兩件事。首先，必須為粒子系統加入移動，"
"因為亂流僅會影響粒子的移動方向與速度，但無法創造移動。你可以透過給予粒子系統"
"重力，或是加入多個吸引器，讓粒子遵循更複雜的路徑。接著，需於 :ref:`粒子處理材"
"質中啟用亂流 <doc_process_material_properties_turbulence>`。啟用後即可調整所"
"有亂流屬性。"

msgid ""
"Turbulence makes use of 3D noise, which has a high performance cost on the "
"GPU. Only enable turbulence on a few particle systems on screen at most. "
"Using turbulence is not recommended when targeting mobile/web platforms."
msgstr ""
"亂流會使用 3D 雜訊，這對 GPU 來說相當耗效能。建議同時間螢幕上僅啟用少數粒子系"
"統的亂流。若目標平台為行動裝置或網頁，不建議啟用亂流。"

msgid "Noise properties"
msgstr "雜訊屬性"

msgid ""
"The basis for particle turbulence is a noise pattern. There are several "
"properties that allow you to manipulate different attributes of this pattern."
msgstr "粒子亂流的基礎是雜訊圖樣。你可以透過數個屬性調整此圖樣的各種特性。"

msgid ""
"The ``Noise Strength`` property controls the pattern's contrast, which "
"affects the overall turbulence sharpness. A lower value creates a softer "
"pattern where individual movement paths are not as sharply separated from "
"another. Set this to a higher number to make the pattern more distinct."
msgstr ""
"「Noise Strength」（雜訊強度）屬性會控制圖樣的對比度，影響亂流的銳利度。較低"
"的值會產生較柔和的圖樣，各移動路徑間分界不明顯；較高的值則讓圖樣更為鮮明。"

msgid "Turbulence noise strength"
msgstr "亂流雜訊強度"

msgid ""
"At a value of 1 (left), the noise strength produces softer turbulence "
"patterns than at 20 (right)"
msgstr ""
"雜訊強度設為 1（左）時，產生的亂流圖樣較柔和；設為 20（右）時則更銳利分明"

msgid ""
"The ``Noise Scale`` property controls the pattern's frequency. It basically "
"changes the noise texture's UV scale where a smaller value produces finer "
"detail, but repeating patterns become noticeable faster. A larger value "
"results in a weaker turbulence pattern overall, but the particle system can "
"cover a larger area before repetition starts to become an issue."
msgstr ""
"「Noise Scale」（雜訊縮放）屬性用來控制圖樣的頻率，實際上就是調整雜訊貼圖的 "
"UV 縮放。較小的值產生更細緻的效果，但重複圖樣會較快出現。較大的值則使亂流圖樣"
"相對鬆散，可在更大的區域內避免重複。"

msgid "Turbulence noise scale"
msgstr "亂流雜訊縮放"

msgid ""
"Turbulence noise scale produces finer details at a value of 1.5 (left) than "
"at 6 (right)"
msgstr "雜訊縮放值設為 1.5（左）時細節較豐富，設為 6（右）時則較為粗糙"

msgid ""
"The ``Noise Speed`` property takes a vector and controls the noise panning "
"speed and direction. This allows you to move the noise pattern over time, "
"which adds another layer of movement variation to the particle system."
msgstr ""
"「Noise Speed」（雜訊速度）屬性接受一個向量，用來控制雜訊圖樣的平移速度與方"
"向。這可讓雜訊圖樣隨時間移動，為粒子系統帶來更多動態變化。"

msgid ""
"Don't mix up particle movement speed and noise panning speed! They are two "
"different things. Particle movement is determined by a number of properties, "
"including the turbulence noise. The ``Noise Speed`` property moves the "
"pattern itself, which in turn changes where the noise affects the particles."
msgstr ""
"請勿混淆粒子移動速度與雜訊平移速度！這兩者是不同的。粒子移動速度受多種屬性影"
"響（包含亂流雜訊），而「Noise Speed」是讓雜訊圖樣本身移動，進而改變雜訊對粒子"
"的作用位置。"

msgid ""
"At a value of ``(X=0,Y=0,Z=0)``, the noise pattern doesn't move at all. The "
"influence on particle movement stays the same at any given point. Set the "
"speed to ``(X=1,Y=0,Z=0)`` instead, and the noise pattern moves along the X-"
"axis."
msgstr ""
"當值為 ``(X=0,Y=0,Z=0)`` 時，雜訊圖樣完全不會移動，對粒子的影響在任何時刻都不"
"變。若設為 ``(X=1,Y=0,Z=0)``，雜訊圖樣會沿 X 軸移動。"

msgid ""
"The ``Noise Speed Random`` property adds some randomness to the noise "
"panning speed. This helps with breaking up visible patterns, especially at "
"higher panning speeds when repetition becomes noticeable faster."
msgstr ""
"「Noise Speed Random」（雜訊速度隨機）屬性會為雜訊平移速度增加隨機性，有助於"
"打散顯著的圖樣，特別是在高速度時，減少重複感。"

msgid "Influence properties"
msgstr "影響力屬性"

msgid ""
"The influence properties determine how much each particle is affected by "
"turbulence. Use ``Influence Min`` to set a minimum value and ``Influence "
"Max`` to set a maximum value. When a particle spawns, the influence is "
"randomly chosen from within this range. You can also set up a curve with the "
"``Influence Over Life`` property that modifies that value over each "
"particle's lifetime. These three properties together control the strength of "
"the turbulence's effect on the particle system :ref:`as described before "
"<doc_process_material_properties>`."
msgstr ""
"影響力相關屬性決定每個粒子受到亂流影響的程度。利用「Influence Min」（最小影響"
"力）與「Influence Max」（最大影響力）設置範圍，每個新生成的粒子都會隨機獲得此"
"範圍內的影響力值。你也可以透過「Influence Over Life」（生命週期影響力）設定曲"
"線，讓影響力隨粒子壽命變化。這三個屬性共同決定亂流對粒子系統的效果強度，詳細"
"請參考 :ref:`前述說明 <doc_process_material_properties>`。"

msgid ""
"Since these properties affect the overall influence of the turbulence over a "
"particle system, both movement direction and speed change as you set "
"different values. A stronger influence causes a particle to move faster and "
"all particles to follow along narrower paths as a result of that."
msgstr ""
"這些屬性會影響亂流對整個粒子系統的作用力，改變不同值時，粒子的移動方向與速度"
"都會有所變化。影響力越強，粒子移動得越快，且路徑也會變得更集中。"

msgid "Turbulence influence"
msgstr "亂流影響力"

msgid ""
"Notice how the particle paths are more narrow and less spread out at high "
"influence values (right)"
msgstr "影響力值高時（右圖），粒子的路徑更集中，擴散範圍也較小"

msgid "Displacement properties"
msgstr "位移屬性"

msgid ""
"Displacement changes a particle's starting position. Use ``Initial "
"Displacement Min`` to set a lower limit and ``Initial Displacement Max`` to "
"set an upper limit. When a particle spawns, the amount of displacement is "
"randomly chosen from within this range and multiplied by a random direction."
msgstr ""
"位移會改變粒子的初始位置。利用「Initial Displacement Min」（最小初始位移）和"
"「Initial Displacement Max」（最大初始位移）設定範圍，新生成的粒子會隨機取得"
"這個範圍內的位移值，並乘上一個隨機方向。"

msgid ""
"Displacement is very useful to break up regular shapes or to create complex "
"shapes from simpler ones. The only difference between the particle systems "
"in the screenshot below is the value given to the displacement properties."
msgstr ""
"位移非常適合打破規則形狀，或由簡單形狀生成複雜圖案。下方截圖的粒子系統唯一差"
