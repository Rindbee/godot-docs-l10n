"Particle attractors are nodes that apply a force to all particles within "
"their reach. They pull particles closer or push them away based on the "
"direction of that force. There are three types of "
"attractors: :ref:`class_GPUParticlesAttractorBox3D`, :ref:`class_GPUParticlesAttractorSphere3D`, "
"and :ref:`class_GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D`. You can instantiate "
"them at runtime and change their properties from gameplay code; you can even "
"animate and combine them for complex attraction effects."

"粒子吸引器是會對其範圍內所有粒子施加力的節點。它們會根據力量的方向，將粒子拉"

"與 :ref:`class_GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D`。你可以在執行時動態建立它"

msgid "Particle attractors are not yet implemented for 2D particle systems."
msgstr "目前 2D 粒子系統尚未實作粒子吸引器功能。"

"The first thing you have to do if you want to use attractors is enable the "
"``Attractor Interaction`` property on the ParticleProcessMaterial. Do this "
"for every particle system that needs to react to attractors. Like most "
"properties in Godot, you can also change this at runtime."
msgstr ""
"若要使用吸引器，首先需在 ParticleProcessMaterial 上啟用 ``Attractor "

msgstr ""
"所有吸引器都擁有一些共同屬性，這些屬性位於屬性面板的 "
"``GPUParticlesAttractor3D`` 區塊中。"

"``Strength`` controls how strong the attractor force is. A positive value "
"pulls particles closer to the attractor's center, while a negative value "
"pushes them away."
msgstr ""
"「Strength」（強度）控制吸引器施加力量的強弱。正值會將粒子拉向吸引器中心，負"
"值則會將粒子推離。"

msgid ""
"``Attenuation`` controls the strength falloff within the attractor's "
"influence region. Every particle attractor has a boundary. Its strength is "
"weakest at the border of this boundary and strongest at its center. "
"Particles outside of the boundary are not affected by the attractor at all. "
"The attenuation curve controls how the strength weakens over that distance. "
"A straight line means that the strength is proportional to the distance: if "
"a particle is halfway between the boundary and the center, the attractor "
"strength will be half of what it is at the center. Different curve shapes "
"change how fast particles accelerate towards the attractor."
msgstr ""
"「Attenuation」（衰減）決定吸引器影響區域內力量的遞減方式。每個粒子吸引器都有"
"一個邊界，其力量在邊界處最弱、中心最強。邊界外的粒子完全不受影響。衰減曲線則"
"決定力量隨距離遞減的方式。若為直線，代表力量與距離成正比：若粒子位於中心與邊"
"界的中間位置，吸引強度則為中心的一半。不同的曲線形狀會決定粒子加速靠近吸引器"
"的速度。"

"The ``Directionality`` property changes the direction towards which "
"particles are pulled. At a value of ``0.0``, there is no directionality, "
"which means that particles are pulled towards the attractor's center. At "
"``1.0``, the attractor is fully directional, which means particles will be "
"pulled along the attractor's local ``-Z``-axis. You can change the global "
"direction by rotating the attractor. If ``Strength`` is negative, particles "
"are instead pulled along the ``+Z``-axis."
msgstr ""
"「Directionality」（方向性）屬性會影響粒子被吸引的方向。當數值為 ``0.0`` 時，"
"粒子會被吸向吸引器中心；設為 ``1.0`` 時，則粒子會沿吸引器的本地 ``-Z`` 軸方向"
"被吸引。你也可以旋轉吸引器來改變全域方向。如果「Strength」為負值，則粒子會沿 "

"The ``Cull Mask`` property controls which particle systems are affected by "
"an attractor based on each system's :ref:`visibility layers "
"<class_VisualInstance3D>`. A particle system is only affected by an "
"attractor if at least one of the system's visibility layers is enabled in "

msgid ""
"The pixel color values map to direction vectors in space. The image below "
"provides an overview. Since particles can move in two directions along each "
