msgid "Faking global illumination"
msgstr "偽造全域照明"

msgid "Why fake global illumination?"
msgstr "為什麼要偽造全域照明？"

msgid ""
"Godot provides several global illumination (GI) techniques, all with their "
"advantages and drawbacks. Nonetheless, it remains possible to avoid using "
"any GI technique and use a handmade approach instead. There are a few "
"reasons for using a \"handmade\" approach to global illumination instead of "
"VoxelGI, SDFGI or baked lightmaps:"
msgstr ""
"Godot 提供了數種全域照明（GI）技術，各有其優缺點。然而，你也可以完全不使用 "
"GI 技術，改採手動方式。選擇手動處理全域照明（而不是 VoxelGI、SDFGI 或烘焙光照"
"貼圖）的理由包括："

msgid ""
"You need to have good rendering performance, but can't afford going through "
"a potentially cumbersome lightmap baking process."
msgstr "你需要良好的繪圖效能，但又無法承受繁瑣的光照貼圖烘焙流程。"

msgid ""
"You need an approach to GI that is fully real-time *and* works in "
"procedurally generated levels."
msgstr "你需要一種能夠全即時、且可支援程式化產生關卡的 GI 解法。"

msgid ""
"You need an approach to GI that is fully real-time *and* does not suffer "
"from significant light leaks."
msgstr "你需要一種全即時且不會明顯漏光的 GI 方法。"

msgid ""
"The approaches described below only cover indirect diffuse lighting, not "
"specular lighting. For specular lighting, consider using ReflectionProbes "
"which are usually cheap enough to be used in conjunction with this fake GI "
"approach."
msgstr ""
"以下介紹的方法僅涵蓋間接漫射光，並不包含鏡面反射光。若需鏡面反射，建議搭配 "
"ReflectionProbes 使用，這類探針通常效能負擔低，適合和這些假 GI 技術一起運用。"

msgid ""
"Not sure if faking global illumination with lights is suited to your needs? "
"See :ref:`doc_introduction_to_global_illumination_comparison` for a "
"comparison of GI techniques available in Godot 4."
msgstr ""
"不確定用燈光模擬全域照明是否適合你的需求嗎？請參"
"考 :ref:`doc_introduction_to_global_illumination_comparison`，了解 Godot 4 支"
"援的各種 GI 技術比較。"

msgid "Faking DirectionalLight3D global illumination"
msgstr "模擬 DirectionalLight3D 的全域照明"

msgid ""
"While the sky provides its own directional lighting, the scene's main "
"DirectionalLight3D node typically emits a large amount of light. When using "
"a GI technique, this light would be reflected on solid surfaces and would "
"bounce back on most outdoors shaded surfaces."
msgstr ""
"雖然天空本身會提供定向光，場景中的主要 DirectionalLight3D 節點通常也會發出大"
"量光線。使用 GI 技術時，這些光會在實體表面反射，並在多數戶外陰影區域產生二次"
"反射。"

msgid ""
"We can fake this by adding a second DirectionalLight3D node with the "
"following changes:"
msgstr ""
"我們可以透過新增第二個 DirectionalLight3D 節點，並做以下設定來模擬這種效果："

msgid ""
"Rotate the light by 180 degrees. This allows it to represent lighting "
"bounced by the main DirectionalLight3D node."
msgstr "將這盞燈旋轉 180 度，讓它模擬主 DirectionalLight3D 反射回來的光線。"

msgid ""
"Set **Shadows** to **Off**. This reduces the secondary light's performance "
"burden while also allowing shaded areas to receive *some* lighting (which is "
"what we want here)."
msgstr ""
"將 **陰影** 設為 **關閉**，同時降低輔助光的效能負擔，並讓陰影區域能獲得「一"
"些」照明（這正是所需效果）。"

msgid ""
"Set **Energy** to 10-40% of the original value. There is no \"perfect\" "
"value, so experiment with various energy values depending on the light and "
"your typical material colors."
msgstr ""
"將 **能量** 調整為原始值的 10-40%。沒有「絕對正確」的數值，請根據實際燈光和材"
"質顏色自行微調。"

msgid ""
"Set **Specular** to ``0.0``. Indirect lighting shouldn't emit visible "
"specular lobes, so we need to disable specular lighting entirely for the "
"secondary light."
msgstr ""
"將 **鏡面** （Specular）設為 ``0.0`` ，間接光通常不會產生可見的鏡面反射，因此"
"需要完全關閉輔助光的鏡面效果。"

msgid ""
"This approach works best in scenes that are mostly outdoors. When going "
"indoors, the secondary DirectionalLight3D's light will still be visible as "
"this light has shadows disabled."
msgstr ""
"這種作法最適合大多數為戶外場景的情境。進入室內時，由於輔助 "
"DirectionalLight3D 關閉陰影，光線會在室內仍然可見。"

msgid ""
"This can be worked around by smoothly decreasing the secondary "
"DirectionalLight3D's energy when entering an indoor area (and doing the "
"opposite when leaving the indoor area). For instance, this can be achieved "
"using an Area3D node and AnimationPlayer."
msgstr ""
"你可以在進入室內時，平滑地降低輔助 DirectionalLight3D 的能量（離開時再恢"
"復），這個流程可以用 Area3D 搭配 AnimationPlayer 來達成。"

msgid "Faking positional light global illumination"
msgstr "模擬位置光源的全域照明"

msgid ""
"It's possible to follow the same approach as DirectionalLight3D for "
"positional lights (OmniLight3D and SpotLight3D). However, this will require "
"more manual work as this operation needs to be repeated for every positional "
"light node in the scene to look good."
msgstr ""
"對於位置光源（OmniLight3D 與 SpotLight3D），也能用類似 DirectionalLight3D 的"
"手法。不過這需要對場景內每一個位置光進行多次手動設定才能達到理想效果。"

msgid ""
"In an ideal scenario, additional OmniLight3Ds should be added at every "
"location where a significant amount of light hits a bright enough surface. "
"However, due to time constraints, this isn't always easily feasible "
"(especially when performing procedural level generation)."
msgstr ""
"理想情況下，每當大量光線照射在夠亮的表面時都應新增一個輔助 OmniLight3D。但由"
"於時間或設計限制（尤其在程式化關卡生成時），通常沒辦法全部手動處理。"

msgid ""
"If you're in a hurry, you can place a secondary OmniLight3D node at the same "
"position as the main OmniLight3D node. You can add this node as a child of "
"the main OmniLight3D node to make it easy to move and hide both nodes at the "
"same time."
msgstr ""
"如果趕時間，可以直接將輔助 OmniLight3D 節點放在主要 OmniLight3D 同一位置，並"
"將其設為主節點的子節點，日後就能一起移動或隱藏。"

msgid "In the secondary OmniLight3D node, perform the following changes:"
msgstr "在輔助 OmniLight3D 節點上，請做以下設定："

msgid ""
"Increase the light's **Range** by 25-50%. This allows the secondary light to "
"lighten what was previously not lit by the original light."
msgstr ""
"將 **範圍** （Range）增加 25-50%，讓輔助光可以補足原本主光未照亮的區域。"

msgid ""
"Set **Energy** to 10-40% of the original value. There is no \"perfect\" "
"value, so experiment with various energy values depending on the light and "
"its surroundings."
msgstr ""
"將 **能量** 設為主光的 10-40%。沒有絕對標準值，依光線與場景實際狀況調整。"

msgid ""
"Set **Specular** to 0. Indirect lighting shouldn't emit visible specular "
"lobes, so we need to disable specular lighting entirely for the secondary "
"light."
msgstr ""
"將 **鏡面** （Specular）設為 0，間接光不會產生明顯的鏡面反射，所以要完全關閉"
"輔助光的鏡面效果。"

msgid ""
"For SpotLight3D, the same trick can be used. In this case, the secondary "
"OmniLight3D should be placed in a way that reflects where *most* light will "
"be bounced. This is usually close to the SpotLight3D's primary impact "
"location."
msgstr ""
"對於 SpotLight3D 也能用同樣方法。這時輔助 OmniLight3D 的擺放位置應該靠近 "
"SpotLight3D 主要照射、光線最多反射的區域。"

msgid ""
"In the example below, a SpotLight3D node is used to light up the room's "
"floor. However, since there is no indirect lighting, the rest of the room "
"remains entirely dark. In real life, the room's walls and ceiling would be "
"lit up by light bouncing around. Using an OmniLight3D node positioned "
"between the SpotLight3D's origin and the floor allows simulating this effect:"
msgstr ""
"下圖範例中，SpotLight3D 用來照亮房間地板，但由於沒有間接照明，其他區域仍然很"
"暗。現實中，牆壁和天花板會因光線反彈而亮起。如果在 SpotLight3D 的起點與地板之"
"間放一個 OmniLight3D，就能模擬這種效果："
