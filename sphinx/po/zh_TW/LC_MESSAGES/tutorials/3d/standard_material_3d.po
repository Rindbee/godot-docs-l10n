"``StandardMaterial3D`` and ``ORMMaterial3D`` (Occlusion, Roughness, "

msgid "Transparency"

msgid ""
"By default, materials in Godot are opaque. This is fast to render, but it "

msgstr ""
"Godot 的材質預設為不透明，這樣可以加快算繪速度。但即使你在 **反照率 > 紋理** "

"To be able to see through a material, the material needs to be made "

msgid ""
"**Disabled:** Material is opaque. This is the fastest to render, with all "

"**Disabled：** 材質為不透明。這是算繪最快、支援所有算繪特性的預設模式。"

msgid ""
"**Alpha:** Material is transparent. Semi-transparent areas are drawn with "
"blending. This is slow to render, but it allows for partial transparency "
"(also known as translucency). Materials using alpha blending also can't cast "
"shadows, and are not visible in screen-space reflections."
msgstr ""
"**Alpha：** 材質為透明。半透明區域會用混合方式算繪。這種模式較慢，但可呈現局"

msgid "**Alpha** is a good fit for particle effects and VFX."
msgstr "**Alpha** 模式適合用於粒子特效與視覺特效（VFX）。"

msgid ""
"**Alpha Scissor:** Material is transparent. Semi-transparent areas whose "
"opacity is below **Alpha Scissor Threshold** are not drawn (above this "
"opacity, these are drawn as opaque). This is faster to render than Alpha and "
"doesn't exhibit transparency sorting issues. The downside is that this "

"possible. Materials using alpha scissor can cast shadows."
msgstr ""
"**Alpha Scissor：** 材質為透明。半透明區域若其透明度低於 **Alpha Scissor 閾值"
"** 就不會被算繪（高於則以不透明算繪）。這比 Alpha 模式算繪快，且不會有透明排"

msgid ""
"**Alpha Hash:** Material is transparent. Semi-transparent areas are drawn "

"viewport resolution. Materials using alpha hash can cast shadows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Depth Pre-Pass:** This renders the object's fully opaque pixels via the "

"allows transparency sorting to be *mostly* correct (albeit not fully so, as "
"partially transparent regions may still exhibit incorrect sorting). "
"Materials using depth prepass can cast shadows."
msgstr ""
"**Depth Pre-Pass：** 先把物件的不透明像素用不透明管線算繪，再用 Alpha 混合算"

msgid ""
"When the alpha antialiasing mode is set to **Alpha Edge Blend** or **Alpha "
"Edge Clip**, a new **Alpha Antialiasing Edge** property becomes visible "
"below in the inspector. This property controls the threshold below which "
"pixels should be made transparent. While you've already defined an alpha "
"scissor threshold (when using **Alpha Scissor** only), this additional "
"threshold is used to smoothly transition between opaque and transparent "
"pixels. **Alpha Antialiasing Edge** must *always* be set to a value that is "
"strictly below the alpha scissor threshold. The default of ``0.3`` is a "

msgstr ""
"當 Alpha 抗鋸齒模式設為 **Alpha Edge Blend** 或 **Alpha Edge Clip** 時，會多"
