"The gaming community isn't monolingual or monocultural. It's made up of many "
"different languages and cultures - just like the Godot community! If you "
"want to allow players to experience your game in their language, one of "
"things you'll need to provide is text translations, which Godot supports via "
"internationalized text."
msgstr ""
"遊戲社群並非只有單一語言或文化，而是集合了來自世界各地、各種語言與文化的玩"
"家，Godot 社群也是如此！如果你希望讓玩家能用自己的語言體驗你的遊戲，那你就需"
"要加入多語系翻譯，而 Godot 內建就有支援國際化文字的功能。"

"In regular desktop or mobile applications, internationalized text is usually "
"located in resource files (or .po files for GNU stuff). Games, however, can "
"use several orders of magnitude more text than applications, so they must "
"support efficient methods for dealing with loads of multilingual text."
msgstr ""
"一般桌面或手機應用程式的國際化文字通常都存在資源檔（或 GNU 類應用用 .po "
"檔）。但遊戲通常會用到比應用程式多得多的文字，因此需要更有效率的多語系文字處"
"理方式。"

msgid ""
"There are two approaches to generate multilingual language games and "
"applications. Both are based on a key:value system. The first is to use one "
"of the languages as the key (usually English), the second is to use a "
"specific identifier. The first approach is probably easier for development "
"if a game is released first in English, later in other languages, but a "
"complete nightmare if working with many languages at the same time."
msgstr ""
"要做多語系遊戲／應用程式，通常有兩種做法，都是 key:value（鍵值對）系統。第一"
"種是直接用某語言（通常是英文）的原文當 key，第二種則用獨立的識別字串當 key。"
"第一種如果是「先出英文、再慢慢加語言」的流程會很方便，但如果同時要維護多語言"
"就會變成惡夢。"

msgid ""
"In general, games use the second approach and a unique ID is used for each "
"string. This allows you to revise the text while it is being translated to "
"other languages. The unique ID can be a number, a string, or a string with a "
"number (it's just a unique string anyway)."
msgstr ""
"遊戲開發通常是採第二種，每段文字都給一個唯一的 ID。這樣一來，即使翻譯進行中要"
"改原文，也不會影響其他語言。這個唯一 ID 可以用數字、字串、或任何唯一的組合。"

msgid ""
"If you need a more powerful file format, Godot also supports loading "
"translations written in the gettext ``.po`` format. "
"See :ref:`doc_localization_using_gettext` for details."
msgstr ""
"如果你需要更進階的格式，Godot 也支援 gettext ``.po`` 格式的翻譯檔。詳細說明請"
"見 :ref:`doc_localization_using_gettext`。"
