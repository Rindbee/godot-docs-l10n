"When dealing with 3D assets, Godot has a flexible and configurable importer."
msgstr "Godot 有靈活可設定的 3D 資源匯入工具。"

"Godot works with *scenes*. This means that the entire scene being worked on "
"in your favorite 3D modeling software will be transferred as close as "
"possible."
msgstr ""
"Godot 以 **場景** 來作業。這表示，可以將您慣用的 3D DCC 中整個場景匯入轉換為"
"非常相近的結果。"

msgid "Godot supports the following 3D *scene file formats*:"

"``.blend`` (Blender). This works by calling Blender to export to glTF in a "
"transparent manner (requires Blender to be installed)."
msgstr ""
"``.blend``（攪拌機）。這是透過呼叫 Blender 以透明方式匯出到 glTF 來實作的（需"

msgstr ""
"作為 glTF 文字檔，二進位資料和紋理獨立（``.gltf`` 檔案 + ``.bin`` 檔案 + 紋"
"理）。"

msgid ""
"There are two reasons to use glTF with the textures separate. One is to have "
"the scene description in a text based format and the binary data in a "
"separate binary file. This can be useful for version control if you want to "
"review changes in a text-based format. The second is you need the texture "
"files separate from the material file. If you don't need either of those, "
"glTF binary files are fine."
msgstr ""
"有兩種情況會需要將 glTF 與紋理分別匯入。其中一種情況是需要讓場景由純文字檔來"
"描述、讓二進位資料保存在獨立的二進位檔案中，這樣子便適用於版本控制系統，可以"
"用基於文字的格式來審閱改動。第二種情況是檔需要將紋理與材質檔分開的時候。若沒"
"有需要這兩種情況的話，則用 glTF 二進位檔即可。"

msgstr "無論如何匯出不變形的骨骼都會導致不正確的著色。"

"Blender, it must be brought in separately."
msgstr ""
"Blender 匯出的 glTF 檔不包含放射紋理 (Emissive Texture)。若模型使用放射紋理，"
"則必須分開匯入。"

msgid ""
"By default, Blender has backface culling disabled on materials and will "
"export materials to match how they render in Blender. This means that "
"materials in Godot will have their cull mode set to **Disabled**. This can "
"decrease performance since backfaces will be rendered, even when they are "
"being culled by other faces. To resolve this, enable **Backface Culling** in "
"Blender's Materials tab, then export the scene to glTF again."
msgstr ""
"預設情況下，Blender 在材質上禁用背面剔除，匯出材質時配對其在 Blender 中的算繪"
"方式。這意味著 Godot 中的材質會將其剔除模式設定為 **Disabled**。這會降低性"

"It is **strongly** recommended to use an official Blender release downloaded "

msgstr ""

"This allows you to iterate on your 3D scenes faster, as you can save the "
"scene in Blender, alt-tab back to Godot then see your changes immediately. "
"When working with version control, this is also more efficient as you no "

msgstr ""
