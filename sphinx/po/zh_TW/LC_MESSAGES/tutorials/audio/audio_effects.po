msgid "Audio effects"
msgstr "音效"

msgid ""
"Godot includes several audio effects that can be added to an audio bus to "
"alter every sound file that goes through that bus."
msgstr ""
"Godot 包含多種音訊效果，可以將它們新增到音訊匯流排以更改通過該匯流排的每個音"
"訊檔。"

msgid ""
"Try them all out to get a sense of how they alter sound. Here follows a "
"short description of the available effects:"
msgstr "請嘗試全部效果來體驗它們如何改變聲音。以下是各個可用效果的簡要介紹："

msgid "Amplify"
msgstr "增幅(Amplify)"

msgid ""
"Amplify changes the volume of the signal. Some care needs to be taken, "
"though: setting the level too high can make the sound digitally clip, which "
"can produce unpleasant crackles and pops."
msgstr ""
"增幅用於改變信號的音量。不過要小心，若增幅設得太高，聲音可能會產生數位削波，"
"導致不悅耳的雜音或爆音。"

msgid "BandLimit and BandPass"
msgstr "帶限和帶通(BandLimit and BandPass)"

msgid ""
"These are resonant filters which block frequencies around the *Cutoff* "
"point. BandPass can be used to simulate sound passing through an old "
"telephone line or megaphone. Modulating the BandPass frequency can simulate "
"the sound of a wah-wah guitar pedal, think of the guitar in Jimi Hendrix's "
"*Voodoo Child (Slight Return)*."
msgstr ""
"它們是共振濾波器，在 *截斷* (Cutoff)點附近阻斷頻率。帶通濾波器可以用來類比舊"
"電話線路或擴音器傳出的聲音。調節帶通濾波器的頻率，可以類比吉他哇音(wah-wah)踏"
"板的聲音，想想吉米•亨德里克斯在 *Voodoo Child (Slight Return)* 中使用的吉他"
"吧。"

msgid "Capture"
msgstr "擷取"

msgid ""
"The Capture effect copies the audio frames of the audio bus that it is on "
"into an internal buffer. This can be used to capture data from the "
"microphone or to transmit audio over the network in real-time."
msgstr ""
"Capture（採集）效果器會將其所在音訊匯流排的音訊影格複製到內部緩衝區中。可用於"
"從麥克風獲取音訊或通過網路即時傳輸音訊。"

msgid "Chorus"
msgstr "和聲"

msgid ""
"As the name of the effect implies, the Chorus effect makes a single audio "
"sample sound like an entire chorus. It does this by duplicating a signal and "
"very slightly altering the timing and pitch of each duplicate, and varying "
"that over time via an LFO (low frequency oscillator). The duplicate(s) are "
"then mixed back together with the original signal, producing a lush, wide, "
"and large sound. Although chorus is traditionally used for voices, it can be "
"desirable with almost any type of sound."
msgstr ""
"如同效果名稱所示，合聲效果使單一音訊樣本聽起來像整個合唱團。它透過複製訊號並"
"極細微地改變每個複製訊號的時序和音高，並透過 LFO (低頻振盪器) 使其隨時間變化"
"來實現。然後將複製訊號與原始訊號混合回去，產生豐富、寬廣、龐大的聲音。雖然合"
"聲傳統上用於人聲，但它幾乎適用於任何類型的聲音。"

msgid "Compressor"
msgstr "壓縮(Compressor)"

msgid ""
"A dynamic range compressor automatically attenuates (ducks) the level of the "
"incoming signal when its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The level of "
"attenuation applied is proportional to how far the incoming audio exceeds "
"the threshold. The compressor's Ratio parameter controls the degree of "
"attenuation. One of the main uses of a compressor is to reduce the dynamic "
"range of signals with very loud and quiet parts. Reducing the dynamic range "
"of a signal can make it fit more comfortably in a mix."
msgstr ""
"動態範圍壓縮器會在其輸入訊號的振幅超過某個閾值時自動衰減訊號音量。施加的衰減"
"程度與輸入音訊超過閾值的幅度成比例。壓縮器的比例參數控制衰減的程度。壓縮器的"
"主要用途之一是減少包含非常大聲和安靜部分的訊號的動態範圍。減少訊號的動態範圍"
"可以使其更好地融入混音。"

msgid "The compressor has many uses. For example:"
msgstr "壓縮器有很多用途，例如:"

msgid ""
"It can be used in the Master bus to compress the whole output prior to being "
"hit by a limiter, making the effect of the limiter much more subtle."
msgstr ""
"可以用在主匯流排上，先壓縮整體輸出再由限幅器處理，使限幅器的效果更加自然。"

msgid ""
"It can be used in voice channels to ensure they sound as even as possible."
msgstr "它可以在人聲通道中使用，使它們聽起來盡可能均勻。"

msgid ""
"It can be *sidechained* by another sound source. This means it can reduce "
"the sound level of one signal using the level of another audio bus for "
"threshold detection. This technique is very common in video game mixing to "
"\"duck\" the level of music or sound effects when in-game or multiplayer "
"voices need to be fully audible."
msgstr ""
"它可以被其他聲音來源 *側鏈*。也就是說，它可以利用另一個音訊匯流排的音量作為閾"
"值偵測，來降低本匯流排的聲音。這種技術在遊戲混音中非常常見，能在遊戲內語音或"
"多人連線語音需要清楚聽見時，讓音樂或音效自動降低音量。"

msgid ""
"It can accentuate transients by using a slower attack. This can make sound "
"effects more punchy."
msgstr "它可以通過較慢的啟動(attack)來突出瞬態，讓音效聽起來更有力。"

msgid ""
"If your goal is to prevent a signal from exceeding a given amplitude "
"altogether, rather than to reduce the dynamic range of the signal, "
"a :ref:`limiter <doc_audio_buses_limiter>` is likely a better choice than a "
"compressor for this purpose. However, applying compression before a limiter "
"is still good practice."
msgstr ""
"如果你的目標是完全防止訊號超過某個振幅，而不是單純降低動態範圍，那麼 :ref:`限"
"幅器 <doc_audio_buses_limiter>` 會比壓縮器更適合。不過，先壓縮再限幅仍是良好"
"的混音習慣。"

msgid "Delay"
msgstr "延遲"

msgid ""
"Digital delay essentially duplicates a signal and repeats it at a specified "
"speed with a volume level that decays for each repeat. Delay is great for "
"simulating the acoustic space of a canyon or large room, where sound bounces "
"have a lot of *delay* between their repeats. This is in contrast to reverb, "
"which has a more natural and blurred sound to it. Using this in conjunction "
"with reverb can create very natural sounding environments!"
msgstr ""
"數位延遲會複製訊號，並以指定的速度重複播放，每次回響音量逐漸遞減。延遲效果很"
"適合模擬峽谷或大房間這類聲音會產生明顯回音的空間。這與混響不同，混響聽起來更"
"自然且模糊。延遲搭配混響使用，可以創造更自然的空間感！"

msgid "Distortion"
msgstr "失真(Distortion)"

msgid "Makes the sound distorted. Godot offers several types of distortion:"
msgstr "讓聲音產生失真效果。Godot 提供多種失真類型："

msgid ""
"*Overdrive* sounds like a guitar distortion pedal or megaphone. Sounds "
"distorted with this sound like they're coming through a low-quality speaker "
"or device."
msgstr ""
"*過載* 聽起來像是吉他效果器或擴音器，經過這種失真的聲音會像來自低品質的喇叭或"
"設備。"

msgid "*Tan* sounds like another interesting flavor of overdrive."
msgstr "*Tan* 則有另一種特殊的過載音色。"

msgid ""
"*Bit crushing* clamps the amplitude of the signal, making it sound flat and "
"crunchy."
msgstr "*位元壓碎* 會限制訊號的振幅，使聲音聽起來更乾扁且粗糙。"

msgid ""
"All three types of distortion can add higher frequency sounds to an original "
"sound, making it stand out better in a mix."
msgstr "這三種失真都能為原始聲音增添高頻成分，讓聲音在混音中更突出。"

msgid "EQ"
msgstr "等化器(EQ)"

msgid ""
"EQ is what all other equalizers inherit from. It can be extended with Custom "
"scripts to create an equalizer with a custom number of bands."
msgstr ""
"所有其他等化器都從EQ繼承而來。可以使用自訂腳本將其擴充，以此建立具有自訂頻段"
"數的等化器。"

msgid "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"
msgstr "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"

msgid ""
"Godot provides three equalizers with different numbers of bands, which are "
"represented in the title (6, 10, and 21 bands, respectively). An equalizer "
"on the Master bus can be useful for cutting low and high frequencies that "
"the device's speakers can't reproduce well. For example, phone or tablet "
"speakers usually don't reproduce low frequency sounds well, and could make a "
"limiter or compressor attenuate sounds that aren't even audible to the user "
"anyway."
msgstr ""
"Godot 提供三種等化器，具有不同數量的頻段，標題中顯示了數量 (分別為 6、10 和 "
"21 頻段)。在主控匯流排上的等化器對於削減裝置揚聲器無法良好重現的低頻和高頻很"
"有用。例如，手機或平板電腦揚聲器通常無法良好重現低頻聲音，並可能使限制器或壓"
"縮器衰減用戶反正聽不到的聲音。"

msgid ""
"Note: The equalizer effect can be disabled when headphones are plugged in, "
"giving the user the best of both worlds."
msgstr ""
"注意：插入耳機時可自動關閉等化器效果，讓用戶在不同設備上都能獲得最佳聆聽體"
"驗。"

msgid "Filter"
msgstr "篩選"

msgid ""
"Filter is what all other filters inherit from and should not be used "
"directly."
msgstr "濾波器是所有其他處理器繼承自的效果，不能直接使用。"

msgid "HardLimiter"
msgstr "硬限幅器(HardLimiter)"

msgid ""
"A limiter is similar to a compressor, but it's less flexible and designed to "
"prevent a signal's amplitude exceeding a given dB threshold. Adding a "
"limiter to the final point of the Master bus is good practice, as it offers "
"an easy safeguard against clipping."
msgstr ""
"限幅器和壓縮器類似，但較不靈活，專為防止訊號超過指定的dB閾值而設計。在主匯流"
"排最後加入限幅器是很好的做法，可有效避免削波。"

msgid "HighPassFilter"
msgstr "Filter - 篩選"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency. HighPassFilter is used "
"to reduce the bass content of a signal."
msgstr ""
"這些濾波器削減低於特定 *截斷* 頻率的頻率. 高通濾波器用於降低訊號的低音含量。"

msgid "HighShelfFilter"
msgstr "高架濾波器(HighShelfFilter)"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "減少所有高於特定 *截斷* 值的頻率。"

msgid "Limiter"
msgstr "限幅器(Limiter)"

msgid ""
"This is the old limiter effect, and it is recommended to use the new "
"HardLimiter effect instead."
msgstr "這是舊版的限幅器效果，建議改用新版的硬限幅器（HardLimiter）。"

msgid ""
"Here is an example of how this effect works, if the ceiling is set to -12 "
"dB, and the threshold is 0 dB, all samples going through get reduced by "
"12dB. This changes the waveform of the sound and introduces distortion."
msgstr ""
"舉例來說，若上限設為 -12 dB 而閾值為 0 dB，所有通過的取樣值都會被降低 12dB。"
"這會改變聲音的波形並產生失真。"

msgid ""
"This effect is being kept to preserve compatibility, however it should be "
"considered deprecated."
msgstr "此效果僅為相容性保留，已不建議使用。"

msgid "LowPassFilter"
msgstr "Filter - 篩選"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency and can also resonate "
"(boost frequencies close to the *Cutoff* frequency). Low pass filters can be "
"used to simulate \"muffled\" sound. For instance, underwater sounds, sounds "
"blocked by walls, or distant sounds."
msgstr ""
"削減高於特定 *截斷* 頻率的頻率，也可以產生共振(加強接近 *截斷* 頻率的頻率)。"
"低通濾波器可以用來模擬 \"沉悶\" 的聲音。例如，水下的聲音, 牆後的聲音或遙遠的"
"聲音。"

msgid "LowShelfFilter"
msgstr "Filter - 篩選"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "削減所有低於特定 *截斷* 值的頻率。"

msgid "NotchFilter"
msgstr "陷波濾波器(NotchFilter)"

msgid ""
"The opposite of the BandPassFilter, it removes a band of sound from the "
"frequency spectrum at a given *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "與帶通濾波器相反, 它從頻譜中的給定的 *截斷* 處移除一個頻段的聲音."

msgid "Panner"
msgstr "聲像(Panner)"

msgid ""
"The Panner allows the stereo balance of a signal to be adjusted between the "
"left and right channels. Headphones are recommended when configuring in this "
"effect."
msgstr ""
"Panner 允許調整訊號在左右聲道之間的立體聲平衡。設定此效果時建議使用耳機。"

msgid "Phaser"
msgstr "移相器(Phaser)"

msgid ""
"This effect is formed by de-phasing two duplicates of the same sound so they "
"cancel each other out in an interesting way. Phaser produces a pleasant "
"whooshing sound that moves back and forth through the audio spectrum, and "
"can be a great way to create sci-fi effects or Darth Vader-like voices."
msgstr ""
"此效果會將同一聲音複製兩份並進行相位偏移，讓它們在某些頻率產生互相抵銷，產生"
"獨特的聲音。移相器會製造出愉悅的「呼嘯」聲效果，很適合用來打造科幻感或類似達"
"斯維達的特殊聲音。"

msgid "PitchShift"
msgstr "移調(PitchShift)"

msgid ""
"This effect allows the adjustment of the signal's pitch independently of its "
"speed. All frequencies can be increased/decreased with minimal effect on "
"transients. PitchShift can be useful to create unusually high or deep "
"voices. Do note that altering pitch can sound unnatural when pushed outside "
"of a narrow window."
msgstr ""
"這個效果讓你能在不改變播放速度的情況下調整音高。所有頻率都能提升或降低，且對"
"瞬態的影響極小。移調效果十分適合用來創造極高或極低的聲音。不過若音高變化過"
"大，可能會產生不自然的聲音。"

msgid "Record"
msgstr "錄製(Record)"

msgid "The Record effect allows the user to record sound from a microphone."
msgstr "Record 效果允許使用者錄製麥克風中的聲音。"

msgid "Reverb"
msgstr "混響(Reverb)"

msgid ""
"Reverb simulates rooms of different sizes. It has adjustable parameters that "
"can be tweaked to obtain the sound of a specific room. Reverb is commonly "
"outputted from :ref:`Area3Ds <class_Area3D>` (see :ref:`Reverb buses "
"<doc_audio_streams_reverb_buses>`), or to apply a \"chamber\" feel to all "
"sounds."
msgstr ""
"殘響會模擬不同大小的房間。它具有可調整的參數，可以微調以獲得特定房間的聲音。"
"殘響通常從 :ref:`Area3D 節點 <class_Area3D>` 輸出 (請參閱 :ref:`殘響匯流排 "
"<doc_audio_streams_reverb_buses>`)，或應用「空間感」到所有聲音。"

msgid "SpectrumAnalyzer"
msgstr "頻譜分析儀(SpectrumAnalyzer)"

msgid ""
"This effect doesn't alter audio, instead, you add this effect to buses you "
"want a spectrum analysis of. This would typically be used for audio "
"visualization. Visualizing voices can be a great way to draw attention to "
"them without just increasing their volume. A demo project using this can be "
"found `here <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/"
