"As you might have already read in :ref:`doc_audio_buses`, sound is sent to "

"An audio stream is an abstract object that emits sound. The sound can come "
"from many places, but is most commonly loaded from the filesystem. Audio "
"files can be loaded as AudioStreams and placed inside an AudioStreamPlayer. "
"You can find information on supported formats and differences in :ref:"
"`doc_importing_audio_samples`."

"音訊流(audio stream)是一種發出聲音的抽象物件. 聲音可以來自許多地方, 最常見的"

"Area2Ds can be used to divert sound from any AudioStreamPlayer2Ds they "
"contain to specific buses. This makes it possible to create buses with "
"different reverb or sound qualities to handle action happening in a "

"Area2D可以將它們包含的AudioStreamPlayer2D的聲音轉移到特定的匯流排上. 這樣就可"
