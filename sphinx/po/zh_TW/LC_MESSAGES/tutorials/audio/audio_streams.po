"As you might have already read in :ref:`doc_audio_buses`, sound is sent to "
"each bus via an AudioStreamPlayer node. There are different kinds of "
"AudioStreamPlayers. Each one loads an AudioStream and plays it back."
msgstr ""
"如你已在 :ref:`doc_audio_buses` 讀到，聲音是透過 AudioStreamPlayer 節點發送至"
"各個音訊匯流排（Bus）。AudioStreamPlayer 有多種類型，每一個都能載入一個 "
"AudioStream 進行播放。"

msgid "AudioStream"
msgstr "AudioStream"

msgid ""
"An audio stream is an abstract object that emits sound. The sound can come "
"from many places, but is most commonly loaded from the filesystem. Audio "
"files can be loaded as AudioStreams and placed inside an AudioStreamPlayer. "
"You can find information on supported formats and differences "
"in :ref:`doc_importing_audio_samples`."
msgstr ""
"音訊流（AudioStream）是一個會發出聲音的抽象物件。聲音來源可以有很多種，最常見"
"的是從檔案系統載入。音訊檔案可以作為 AudioStream 載入，並放到 "
"AudioStreamPlayer 節點內播放。更多支援格式與差異可參"
"考 :ref:`doc_importing_audio_samples`。"

msgid ""
"There are other types of AudioStreams, such "
"as :ref:`AudioStreamRandomizer<class_AudioStreamRandomizer>`. This one picks "
"a different audio stream from a list of streams each time it's played back, "
"and applies random pitch and volume shifting. This can be helpful for adding "
"variation to sounds that are played back often."
msgstr ""
"AudioStream 還有其他類型，例"
"如 :ref:`AudioStreamRandomizer<class_AudioStreamRandomizer>`。這類型每次播放"
"時，會從多個音訊流中隨機選擇一個，並可隨機調整音高和音量。這對於讓經常重複播"
"放的音效聽起來更有變化非常有幫助。"

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer"

msgid ""
"This is the standard, non-positional stream player. It can play to any bus. "
"In 5.1 sound setups, it can send audio to stereo mix or front speakers."
msgstr ""
"這是標準的非定位型音訊流播放器，可將聲音輸出到任何匯流排。在 5.1 聲道配置中，"
"也可以把音訊傳送到立體聲混音或前置喇叭。"

msgid ""
"Playback Type is an experimental setting, and could change in future "
"versions of Godot. It exists so Web exports use Web Audio-API based samples "
"instead of streaming all sounds to the browser, unlike most platforms. This "
"prevents the audio from being garbled in single-threaded Web exports. By "
"default, only the Web platform will use samples. Changing this setting is "
"not recommended, unless you have an explicit reason to. You can change the "
"default playback type for the web and other platforms in the project "
"settings under **Audio > General** (advanced settings must be turned on to "
"see the setting)."
msgstr ""
"播放類型（Playback Type）是一項實驗性設定，未來 Godot 版本可能會變動。設計這"
"個設定主要是為了讓網頁匯出時使用基於 Web Audio API 的取樣器（Sample），而非將"
"所有聲音直接串流到瀏覽器，這與多數其他平台不同。這能避免在單執行緒模式下網頁"
"音訊播放出現雜音。預設情況下，只有網頁平台會使用取樣器。建議不要隨意更動這個"
"設定，除非你有明確需求。你也可以在專案設定中的 **Audio > General** （需開啟進"
"階設定）調整各平台的預設播放類型。"

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer2D"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer2D"

msgid ""
"This is a variant of AudioStreamPlayer, but emits sound in a 2D positional "
"environment. When close to the left of the screen, the panning will go left. "
"When close to the right side, it will go right."
msgstr ""
"這是 AudioStreamPlayer 的 2D 定位變體，能在 2D 空間中發出聲音。當音源靠近螢幕"
"左側時，聲像會偏向左邊；靠近右側時則偏向右邊。"

msgid ""
"Area2Ds can be used to divert sound from any AudioStreamPlayer2Ds they "
"contain to specific buses. This makes it possible to create buses with "
"different reverb or sound qualities to handle action happening in a "
"particular parts of your game world."
msgstr ""
"Area2D 可以讓其內部的 AudioStreamPlayer2D 產生的聲音導向指定的匯流排，這讓你"
"能針對遊戲世界特定區域設計不同的混響或音質效果。"

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer3D"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer3D"

msgid ""
"This is a variant of AudioStreamPlayer, but emits sound in a 3D positional "
"environment. Depending on the location of the player relative to the screen, "
"it can position sound in stereo, 5.1 or 7.1 depending on the chosen audio "
"setup."
msgstr ""
"這是 AudioStreamPlayer 的 3D 定位變體，能在三維空間中播放聲音。根據音源與視點"
"的位置關係，聲音會定位於立體聲、5.1 或 7.1 聲道，取決於你所選的音效配置。"

msgid ""
"Similar to AudioStreamPlayer2D, an Area3D can divert the sound to an audio "
"bus."
msgstr ""
"類似於 AudioStreamPlayer2D，Area3D 也可以將 3D 聲音導向指定的音訊匯流排。"

"Unlike for 2D, the 3D version of AudioStreamPlayer has a few more advanced "

msgstr "和 2D 不同，3D 版的 AudioStreamPlayer 有一些進階設定："

msgid "Reverb buses"

msgid ""
"This feature is not supported on the web platform if the AudioStreamPlayer's "
"playback mode is set to **Sample**, which is the default. It will only work "
"if the playback mode is set to **Stream**, at the cost of increased latency "
"if threads are not enabled."
msgstr ""
"如果 AudioStreamPlayer 的播放模式設為預設的 **Sample**，則此功能在網頁平台上"
"不支援。僅當播放模式設為 **Stream** 時才會運作，但若未啟用多執行緒，延遲可能"

"Godot allows for 3D audio streams that enter a specific Area3D node to send "
"dry and wet audio to separate buses. This is useful when you have several "
"reverb configurations for different types of rooms. This is done by enabling "
"this type of reverb in the **Reverb Bus** section of the Area3D's properties:"
msgstr ""
"Godot 支援 3D 音訊流進入指定 Area3D 節點時，將原音（dry）和混響（wet）分別送"
"到不同的匯流排。如果你有多種房間的混響設定，這功能會很實用。你可以在 Area3D "
"屬性的 **Reverb Bus** 區段啟用對應混響："

msgid ""
"At the same time, a special bus layout is created where each Area3D receives "
"the reverb info from each Area3D. A Reverb effect needs to be created and "
"configured in each reverb bus to complete the setup for the desired effect:"
msgstr ""
"同時，Godot 會建立特殊的匯流排佈局，每個 Area3D 都能接收對應的混響資訊。你必"
"須在每個混響匯流排上建立並設定一個混響效果，才能完成你想要的聲音表現："

msgid ""
"The Area3D's **Reverb Bus** section also has a parameter named "
"**Uniformity**. Some types of rooms bounce sounds more than others (like a "
"warehouse), so reverberation can be heard almost uniformly across the room "
"even though the source may be far away. Playing around with this parameter "
"can simulate that effect."
msgstr ""
"Area3D 的 **Reverb Bus** 區段還有一個稱為 **Uniformity** （均勻度）的參數。有"
"些房間（例如倉庫）比其他房間有更強的聲音反射，因此即使聲源較遠，在整個房間內"
"也能聽到均勻的混響。調整這個參數可以模擬這種真實效果。"

"When the relative velocity between an emitter and listener changes, this is "
"perceived as an increase or decrease in the pitch of the emitted sound. "
"Godot can track velocity changes in the AudioStreamPlayer3D and Camera "
"nodes. Both nodes have this property, which must be enabled manually:"
msgstr ""
"當發射源和接收者之間的相對速度發生變化時, 發出聲音的音高會隨之升高/降低.Godot"
"可以追蹤AudioStreamPlayer3D和Camera節點的速度變化. 這兩個節點都有這個屬性, 需"
