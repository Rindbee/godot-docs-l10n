"It is often desired to use :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)` connections "
"(also known as :abbr:`TLS (Transport Layer Security)` connections) for "
"communications to avoid \"man in the middle\" attacks. Godot has a "
"connection wrapper, :ref:`StreamPeerTLS <class_StreamPeerTLS>`, which can "
"take a regular connection and add security around it. The :ref:`HTTPClient "
"<class_HTTPClient>` and :ref:`HTTPRequest <class_HTTPRequest>` classes also "
"support HTTPS using this same wrapper."

"通常希望使用 SSL 連接進行通信，可以避免“中間人”攻擊。Godot 有一個連接包裝器 :"
"ref:`StreamPeerSSL <class_StreamPeerSSL>`，它可以進行更安全的連接。:ref:"

msgid "There are two ways to obtain certificates:"
msgstr "獲取憑證有兩種方法:"

msgid "Acquire a certificate from a certificate authority"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The main approach to getting a certificate is to use a certificate authority "
"(CA) such as `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`__. This is a more "
"cumbersome process than a self-signed certificate, but it's more "
"\"official\" and ensures your identity is clearly represented. The resulting "
"certificate is also trusted by applications such as web browsers, unlike a "
"self-signed certificate which requires additional configuration on the "
"client side before it's considered trusted."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These certificates do not require any configuration on the client to work, "
"since Godot already bundles the Mozilla certificate bundle in the editor and "
"exported projects."

msgid "Generate a self-signed certificate"
msgstr "方法 1：自簽章憑證"

msgid ""
"For most use cases, it's recommended to go through certificate authority as "
"the process is free with certificate authorities such as Let's Encrypt. "
"However, if using a certificate authority is not an option, then you can "
"generate a self-signed certificate and tell the client to consider your self-"
"signed certificate as trusted."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"To create a self-signed certificate, generate a private and public key pair "
"and add the public key (in PEM format) to the CRT file specified in the "
"Project Settings."
msgstr ""
"第一種方法最簡單: 生成一個私密金鑰和公開金鑰對, 並將公開金鑰(PEM格式)新增到."
"crt檔案中. 私密金鑰應該放到你的伺服器上."

msgid ""
"The private key should **only** go to your server. The client must not have "
"access to it: otherwise, the security of the certificate will be compromised."

"OpenSSL has `some documentation <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/"

"purposes **only**, `mkcert <https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert>`__ can be "
"used as an alternative."

"OpenSSL有 `一些文件 <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openssl/openssl/"
