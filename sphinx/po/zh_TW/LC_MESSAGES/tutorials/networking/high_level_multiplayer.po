"Godot always supported standard low-level networking via :abbr:`UDP (User "
"Datagram Protocol)`, :abbr:`TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)` and some "
"higher-level protocols such as :abbr:`HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)` "
"and :abbr:`SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)`. These protocols are flexible and can "
"be used for almost anything. However, using them to synchronize game state "
"manually can be a large amount of work. Sometimes that work can't be avoided "
"or is worth it, for example when working with a custom server implementation "
"on the backend. But in most cases, it's worthwhile to consider Godot's high-"
"level networking API, which sacrifices some of the fine-grained control of "
"low-level networking for greater ease of use."
msgstr ""
"Godot 一直以來都支援標準的低階網路通訊協定，如 :abbr:`UDP（使用者資料包協定）"
"`、 :abbr:`TCP（傳輸控制協定）`，以及更高階的 :abbr:`HTTP（超文本傳輸協定）"
"`、 :abbr:`SSL（安全通訊層）` 等。這些協定非常彈性，幾乎可以用於任何場合。不"
"過，若要手動透過這些協定來同步遊戲狀態，會需要投入相當多的開發工作。有時這是"
"必要或值得的（例如你在後端使用自訂伺服器實作時）；但大多數情況下，建議優先考"
"慮 Godot 的高階網路 API，雖然會犧牲一些低階細節控制，但能大幅提升開發效率。"

msgid "This is due to the inherent limitations of the low-level protocols:"
msgstr "這是因為低階協定本身的限制："

msgid ""
"TCP ensures packets will always arrive reliably and in order, but latency is "
"generally higher due to error correction. It's also quite a complex protocol "
"because it understands what a \"connection\" is, and optimizes for goals "
"that often don't suit applications like multiplayer games. Packets are "
"buffered to be sent in larger batches, trading less per-packet overhead for "
"higher latency. This can be useful for things like HTTP, but generally not "
"for games. Some of this can be configured and disabled (e.g. by disabling "
"\"Nagle's algorithm\" for the TCP connection)."
msgstr ""
"TCP 能保證封包可靠且按順序到達，但因為要進行錯誤校正，通常會有較高延遲。它本"
"身也是個相當複雜的協定，會處理所謂的「連線」，並針對某些場景（通常不適用於多"
"人遊戲）進行最佳化。封包會被緩衝，等到累積足夠再一起發送，以減少每個封包的額"
"外負擔，但這也會增加延遲。這對 HTTP 等用途來說很有幫助，但對遊戲來說通常不是"
"好事。部分行為可透過設定關閉（如關閉 TCP 的「Nagle 演算法」）。"

msgid ""
"UDP is a simpler protocol, which only sends packets (and has no concept of a "
"\"connection\"). No error correction makes it pretty quick (low latency), "
"but packets may be lost along the way or received in the wrong order. Added "
"to that, the MTU (maximum packet size) for UDP is generally low (only a few "
"hundred bytes), so transmitting larger packets means splitting them, "
"reorganizing them and retrying if a part fails."
msgstr ""
"UDP 協定更簡單，只負責發送資料封包（且沒有「連線」概念）。它不做錯誤修正，所"
"以延遲很低、速度很快，但封包可能會在傳送過程中遺失或順序錯亂。此外，UDP 的 "
"MTU（最大封包大小）通常很小（只有數百位元組），所以傳送較大的資料時必須拆封包"
"並重組，若有部分失敗還需重新傳送。"

msgid ""
"In general, TCP can be thought of as reliable, ordered, and slow; UDP as "
"unreliable, unordered and fast. Because of the large difference in "
"performance, it often makes sense to re-build the parts of TCP wanted for "
"games (optional reliability and packet order), while avoiding the unwanted "
"parts (congestion/traffic control features, Nagle's algorithm, etc). Due to "
"this, most game engines come with such an implementation, and Godot is no "
"exception."
msgstr ""
"總結來說，TCP 屬於可靠、有序、但較慢；UDP 則是不可靠、無序且快速。兩者效能差"
"異很大，因此遊戲常常會自己實作只需要的 TCP 功能（如部分可靠性和排序），而避開"
"某些遊戲不需要的部分（像是壅塞/流量控制、Nagle 演算法等）。因此大多數遊戲引擎"
"都有這類專用網路實作，Godot 也不例外。"

msgid ""
"In summary, you can use the low-level networking API for maximum control and "

"Most of Godot's supported platforms offer all or most of the mentioned high- "
"and low-level networking features. As networking is always largely hardware "
"and operating system dependent, however, some features may change or not be "
