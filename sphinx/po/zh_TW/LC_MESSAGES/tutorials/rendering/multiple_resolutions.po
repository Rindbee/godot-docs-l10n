msgstr "多重解析度的問題"

msgid ""
"Developers often have trouble understanding how to best support multiple "
"resolutions in their games. For desktop and console games, this is more or "

"are standard (720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4K, …)."
msgstr ""
"開發者常常對於如何在遊戲中最佳化支援多種解析度感到困擾。對於桌面和主機遊戲來"

"For mobile games, at first, it was easy. For many years, the iPhone and iPad "
"used the same resolution. When *Retina* was implemented, they just doubled "
"the pixel density; most developers had to supply assets in default and "

msgstr ""
"行動遊戲一開始也很單純。多年來 iPhone 和 iPad 都使用相同的解析度。引入 "

"Nowadays, this is no longer the case, as there are plenty of different "
"screen sizes, densities, and aspect ratios. Non-conventional sizes are also "
"becoming increasingly popular, such as ultrawide displays."
msgstr ""
"現在情況已經不同，市面上有許多不同的螢幕尺寸、密度與長寬比。非傳統尺寸（如超"

msgid ""
"Since layouts, aspect ratios, resolutions, and pixel densities can change so "

"Another method must be used."
msgstr ""
"由於版面配置、長寬比、解析度和像素密度變動幅度大，已經不可能為每一種螢幕設計"

msgid "One size fits all"
msgstr "統一尺寸適配"

msgid ""
"The most common approach is to use a single *base* resolution and then fit "

msgid ""
"Godot follows a modern approach to multiple resolutions. The engine will "

msgstr ""
"Godot 採用現代化的多重解析度處理方式。引擎本身**不會**主動變更螢幕解析度。雖"

msgid ""
"There are several types of devices, with several types of screens, which in "

"by calling ``get_tree().root`` or ``get_node(\"/root\")``)."
msgstr ""
"市面上的裝置類型繁多，螢幕種類、像素密度和解析度都不一樣。要全部兼容非常費"

msgid ""
"In any case, while changing the root Viewport params is probably the most "
"flexible way to deal with the problem, it can be a lot of work, code and "

msgstr ""
"雖然直接修改根 Viewport 參數是最彈性的解法，但這會帶來更多工作量、程式碼與推"
