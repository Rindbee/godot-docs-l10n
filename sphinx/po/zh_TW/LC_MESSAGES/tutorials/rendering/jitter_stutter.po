msgid "What is jitter, stutter and input lag?"
msgstr "什麼是抖動、卡頓與輸入延遲？"

msgid ""
"*Jitter* and *stutter* are two different alterations to visible motion of "
"objects on screen that may affect a game, even when running at full speed. "
"These effects are mostly visible in games where the world moves at a "
"constant speed in a fixed direction, like runners or platformers."
msgstr ""
"*抖動* （jitter）與 *卡頓* （stutter）是畫面物件可見運動的兩種不同異常現象，"
"即使遊戲在滿幀率下運作也可能發生，並影響遊戲體驗。這類效應在世界以固定速度、"
"固定方向運動的遊戲（如跑酷或橫向捲軸平台遊戲）中特別明顯。"

msgid ""
"*Input lag* is unrelated to jitter and stutter, but is sometimes discussed "
"alongside. Input lag refers to visible on-screen delay when performing "
"actions with the mouse, keyboard, controller or touchscreen. It can be "
"related to game code, engine code or external factors (such as hardware). "
"Input lag is most noticeable in games that use the mouse to aim, such as "
"first-person games. Input lag can't be completely eliminated, but it can be "
"reduced in several ways."
msgstr ""
"*輸入延遲* 和抖動、卡頓無直接關聯，但經常一起被討論。輸入延遲是指玩家用滑鼠、"
"鍵盤、控制器或觸控螢幕操作時，畫面反應所產生的可見延遲。其原因可能來自遊戲程"
"式碼、引擎核心，或外部硬體。輸入延遲在需要滑鼠瞄準的遊戲（如第一人稱射擊）中"
"最為明顯。雖然輸入延遲無法完全消除，但可以用多種方法減少。"

msgstr "一款在正常幀率下運作且沒有異常現象的遊戲，畫面會相當流暢："

msgid "A game exhibiting *jitter* will shake constantly in a very subtle way:"
msgstr "出現*抖動*的遊戲會有持續微小晃動的現象："

msgid ""
"Finally, a game exhibiting *stutter* will appear smooth, but appear to "
"*stop* or *roll back a frame* every few seconds:"

msgid ""
"For fullscreen, Windows gives special priority to the game so stutter is no "
"longer visible and very rare. This is how most games are played."
msgstr ""
"在全螢幕模式下，Windows 會給予遊戲特殊優先順序，因此卡頓現象極少見。大多數遊"

"When using a mouse with a polling rate of 1,000 Hz or more, consider using a "
"fully up-to-date Windows 11 installation which comes with fixes related to "
"high CPU utilization with high polling rate mice. These fixes are not "
"available in Windows 10 and older versions."
msgstr ""

"Games should use the **Exclusive Fullscreen** window mode, as opposed to "
"**Fullscreen** which is designed to prevent Windows from automatically "
"treating the window as if it was exclusive fullscreen."
msgstr ""
"遊戲建議使用 **Exclusive Fullscreen**（獨佔全螢幕）視窗模式，而非 "
"**Fullscreen**，因為後者設計目的是避免 Windows 將視窗誤判為獨佔全螢幕。"

msgid ""
"**Fullscreen** is meant to be used by GUI applications that want to use per-"
"pixel transparency without a risk of having it disabled by the OS. It "
"achieves this by leaving a 1-pixel line at the bottom of the screen. By "
"contrast, **Exclusive Fullscreen** uses the actual screen size and allows "
"Windows to reduce jitter and input lag for fullscreen games."
msgstr ""
"**Fullscreen** 主要用於需要每像素透明度且不希望被作業系統關閉這功能的 GUI 應"

"Stutter may be visible on desktop Linux, but this is usually associated with "
"different video drivers and compositors. Some compositors may also trigger "
"this problem (e.g. KWin), so it is advised to try using a different one to "
"rule it out as the cause. Some window managers such as KWin and Xfwm allow "
"you to manually disable compositing, which can improve performance (at the "
"cost of tearing)."
msgstr ""
"在 Linux 桌面環境下，也可能出現卡頓，這通常與顯示卡驅動程式或視窗合成器有關。"
"有些合成器（例如 KWin）會惡化此問題，可以考慮切換其他合成器進行排除。部分視窗"

msgid ""
"There is no workaround for driver or compositor stuttering, other than "

"On platforms that support disabling V-Sync, input lag can be made less "
"noticeable by disabling V-Sync in the project settings. This will however "
"cause tearing to appear, especially on monitors with low refresh rates. It's "
"suggested to make V-Sync available as an option for players to toggle."
msgstr ""
"在支援停用垂直同步的平臺上，可以在專案設定中關閉 V-Sync 以降低輸入延遲，但這"
"樣會導致畫面撕裂，尤其在低刷新率顯示器上。建議讓 V-Sync 作為選項，讓玩家可自"
"行切換。"

msgid ""
"When using the Forward+ or Mobile rendering methods, another way to reduce "
"visual latency when V-Sync is enabled is to use double-buffered V-Sync "
"instead of the default triple-buffered V-Sync. Since Godot 4.3, this can be "
"achieved by reducing the **Display > Window > V-Sync > Swapchain Image "
"Count** project setting to ``2``.  The downside of using double buffering is "
"that framerate will be less stable if the display refresh rate can't be "
"reached due to a CPU or GPU bottleneck. For instance, on a 60 Hz display, if "
"the framerate would normally drop to 55 FPS during gameplay with triple "
"buffering, it will have to drop down to 30 FPS momentarily with double "
"buffering (and then go back to 60 FPS when possible). As a result, double-"
"buffered V-Sync is only recommended if you can *consistently* reach the "
"display refresh rate on the target hardware."
msgstr ""
"當使用 Forward+ 或 Mobile 算繪模式時，若已啟用 V-Sync，還能進一步透過「雙緩"
"衝」取代預設的「三緩衝」來降低視覺延遲。自 Godot 4.3 起，可將 **Display > "
"Window > V-Sync > Swapchain Image Count** 專案設定調整為 ``2`` 即啟用雙緩衝。"
"不過，雙緩衝在無法達到螢幕刷新率時（如 CPU/GPU 效能不足），幀率會變得不穩定。"
"例如 60 Hz 螢幕下，若三緩衝時遊戲幀率約 55 FPS，雙緩衝則會瞬間降到 30 FPS，然"
"後再回升至 60 FPS。因此，僅建議在目標硬體能*穩定*輸出滿幀率時，才使用雙緩衝 "
"V-Sync。"

msgid ""
"Increasing the number of physics iterations per second can also reduce "
"physics-induced input latency. This is especially noticeable when using "
"physics interpolation (which improves smoothness but increases latency). To "
"do so, set **Physics > Common > Physics Ticks Per Second** to a value higher "
"than the default ``60``, or set ``Engine.physics_ticks_per_second`` at "
"runtime in a script. Values that are a multiple of the monitor refresh rate "
"(typically ``60``) work best when physics interpolation is disabled, as they "
"will avoid jitter. This means values such as ``120``, ``180`` and ``240`` "
"are good starting points. As a bonus, higher physics FPSes make tunneling "
"and physics instability issues less likely to occur."
msgstr ""
"提升每秒物理計算次數同樣能降低物理相關的輸入延遲。這在啟用物理內插（即提升平"
"滑度但增加延遲）時更為明顯。您可以將 **Physics > Common > Physics Ticks Per "
"Second** 設定為高於預設值 ``60``，或於執行時透過腳本設定 "
"``Engine.physics_ticks_per_second``。若未啟用物理內插，建議設定為螢幕刷新率的"
"倍數（如 ``120``、``180``、``240``），可避免抖動。額外好處是較高的物理幀率能"
"減少穿透和物理不穩定問題。"

msgid ""
"The downside of increasing physics FPS is that CPU usage will increase, "
"which can lead to performance bottlenecks in games that have heavy physics "
"simulation code. This can be alleviated by increasing physics FPS only in "
"situations where low latency is critical, or by letting players adjust "
"physics FPS to match their hardware. However, different physics FPS will "
"lead to different outcomes in physics simulation, even when ``delta`` is "
"consistently used in your game logic. This can give certain players an "
"advantage over others. Therefore, allowing the player to change the physics "
"FPS themselves should be avoided for competitive multiplayer games."
msgstr ""
"但增加物理幀率會提升 CPU 使用率，對於物理運算量大的遊戲可能造成效能瓶頸。您可"
"選擇僅在低延遲至關重要時提高物理幀率，或讓玩家依硬體調整。不過，即便您的邏輯"
"程式碼都正確使用 ``delta``，不同的物理幀率還是會導致物理模擬結果出現差異，讓"
"部分玩家產生優勢。因此，競技型多人遊戲不建議讓玩家自行調整物理幀率。"

msgid ""
"Lastly, you can disable input buffering on a per-rendered frame basis by "
"calling ``Input.set_use_accumulated_input(false)`` in a script. This will "
"make it so the ``_input()`` and ``_unhandled_input()`` functions in your "
"scripts are called on every input, rather than accumulating inputs and "
"waiting for a frame to be rendered. Disabling input accumulation will "
"increase CPU usage, so it should be done with caution."
msgstr ""
"最後，您也可以在腳本中呼叫 ``Input.set_use_accumulated_input(false)``，以停用"
"每個算繪影格的輸入緩衝。這樣 ``_input()`` 與 ``_unhandled_input()`` 會於每次"
"輸入時立即呼叫，而非累積輸入並等到下一影格才處理。停用輸入累積會增加 CPU 使用"
"率，請謹慎使用。"

"If your monitor supports it, consider enabling variable refresh rate (G-Sync/"
"FreeSync) while leaving V-Sync enabled, then cap the framerate in the "
"project settings to a slightly lower value than your monitor's maximum "
"refresh rate as per `this page <https://blurbusters.com/howto-low-lag-vsync-"
"on/>`__. For example, on a 144 Hz monitor, you can set the project's "
"framerate cap to ``141``. This may be counterintuitive at first, but capping "
"the FPS below the maximum refresh rate range ensures that the OS never has "
"to wait for vertical blanking to finish. This leads to *similar* input lag "
"as V-Sync disabled with the same framerate cap (usually less than 1 ms "
"greater), but without any tearing."
msgstr ""
"若您的顯示器支援，建議同時啟用可變刷新率（G-Sync/FreeSync）及 V-Sync，並依照 "
