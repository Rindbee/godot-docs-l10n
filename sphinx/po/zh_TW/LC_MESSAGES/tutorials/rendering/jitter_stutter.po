msgid "Fixing jitter, stutter and input lag"
msgstr "修正抖動、卡頓與輸入延遲"

msgid "What is jitter, stutter and input lag?"
msgstr "什麼是抖動、卡頓與輸入延遲？"

msgid ""
"*Jitter* and *stutter* are two different alterations to visible motion of "
"objects on screen that may affect a game, even when running at full speed. "
"These effects are mostly visible in games where the world moves at a "
"constant speed in a fixed direction, like runners or platformers."
msgstr ""
"*抖動* （jitter）與 *卡頓* （stutter）是畫面物件可見運動的兩種不同異常現象，"
"即使遊戲在滿幀率下運作也可能發生，並影響遊戲體驗。這類效應在世界以固定速度、"
"固定方向運動的遊戲（如跑酷或橫向捲軸平台遊戲）中特別明顯。"

msgid ""
"*Input lag* is unrelated to jitter and stutter, but is sometimes discussed "
"alongside. Input lag refers to visible on-screen delay when performing "
"actions with the mouse, keyboard, controller or touchscreen. It can be "
"related to game code, engine code or external factors (such as hardware). "
"Input lag is most noticeable in games that use the mouse to aim, such as "
"first-person games. Input lag can't be completely eliminated, but it can be "
"reduced in several ways."
msgstr ""
"*輸入延遲* 和抖動、卡頓無直接關聯，但經常一起被討論。輸入延遲是指玩家用滑鼠、"
"鍵盤、控制器或觸控螢幕操作時，畫面反應所產生的可見延遲。其原因可能來自遊戲程"
"式碼、引擎核心，或外部硬體。輸入延遲在需要滑鼠瞄準的遊戲（如第一人稱射擊）中"
"最為明顯。雖然輸入延遲無法完全消除，但可以用多種方法減少。"

msgid "Distinguishing between jitter and stutter"
msgstr "如何區分抖動與卡頓"

msgid ""
"A game running at a normal framerate without exhibiting any effect will "
"appear smooth:"
msgstr "一款在正常幀率下運作且沒有異常現象的遊戲，畫面會相當流暢："

msgid "A game exhibiting *jitter* will shake constantly in a very subtle way:"
msgstr "出現*抖動*的遊戲會有持續微小晃動的現象："

msgid ""
"Finally, a game exhibiting *stutter* will appear smooth, but appear to "
"*stop* or *roll back a frame* every few seconds:"
msgstr ""
"而出現*卡頓*的遊戲則大致上保持流暢，但每隔幾秒就會*停頓*或*倒退一個影格*："

msgid "Jitter"
msgstr "抖動"

msgid ""
"There can be many causes of jitter. The most typical one happens when the "
"game *physics frequency* (usually 60 Hz) runs at a different resolution than "
"the monitor refresh rate. Check whether your monitor refresh rate is "
"different from 60 Hz."
msgstr ""
"抖動可能有許多成因。最典型的是遊戲的 *物理更新頻率* (通常為 60 Hz) 與螢幕更新"
"率不同所致。請先確認你的螢幕更新率是否不同於 60 Hz。"

msgid ""
"Sometimes, only some objects appear to jitter (character or background). "
"This happens when they are processed in different time sources (one is "
"processed in the physics step while another is processed in the idle step)."
msgstr ""
"有時只有部分物件（例如角色或背景）會出現抖動。這通常是因為它們使用不同的時間"
"來源處理（例如某些在 physics 步處理，另一些在 idle 步處理）。"

msgid ""
"This cause of jitter can be alleviated by enabling :ref:`physics "
"interpolation <doc_physics_interpolation_quick_start_guide>` in the Project "
"Settings. Physics interpolation will smooth out physics updates by "
"interpolating the transforms of physics objects between physics frames. This "
"way, the visual representation of physics objects will always look smooth no "
"matter the framerate and physics tick rate."
msgstr ""
"可以在專案設定中啟用 :ref:`physics interpolation "
"<doc_physics_interpolation_quick_start_guide>` 來緩解這種抖動。物理插值會在物"
"理影格之間對物理物件的變換進行插值，使物理更新更平滑。如此一來，無論影格率或"
"物理更新率為何，物理物件的視覺表現都能保持順暢。"

msgid ""
"Enabling physics interpolation has some caveats you should be aware of. For "
"example, care should be taken when teleporting objects so that they don't "
"visibly interpolate between the old position and new position when it's not "
"intended. See the :ref:`doc_physics_interpolation` documentation for details."
msgstr ""
"啟用物理插值有一些需要注意的地方。例如在瞬移物件時要特別處理，避免在不希望的"
"情況下，物件在舊位置與新位置之間出現可見的插值。詳情請參"
"閱 :ref:`doc_physics_interpolation`。"

msgid ""
"Enabling physics interpolation will increase input lag for behavior that "
"depends on the physics tick, such as player movement. In most games, this is "
"generally preferable to jitter, but consider this carefully for games that "
"operate on a fixed framerate (like fighting or rhythm games). This increase "
"in input lag can be compensated by increasing the physics tick rate as "
"described in the :ref:`doc_jitter_stutter_input_lag` section."
msgstr ""
"啟用物理插值會增加依賴物理更新的行為（例如玩家移動）的輸入延遲。對多數遊戲而"
"言，這通常比抖動更可取，但對固定幀率運作的遊戲（例如格鬥或節奏遊戲）需要審慎"
"評估。你可以如 :ref:`doc_jitter_stutter_input_lag` 章節所述，提高物理更新率來"
"補償這個輸入延遲。"

msgid "Stutter"
msgstr "卡頓"

msgid ""
"Stutter may happen due to several different reasons. One reason is the game "
"not being able to keep full framerate performance due to a CPU or GPU "
"bottleneck. Solving this is game-specific and will "
"require :ref:`optimization <doc_general_optimization>`."
msgstr ""
"卡頓可能由多種因素造成。其中一個原因是 CPU 或 GPU 瓶頸導致遊戲無法維持完整幀"
"率。這屬於遊戲內容層面的議題，需要進行 :ref:`optimization "
"<doc_general_optimization>`。"

msgid ""
"Another common reason for stuttering is *shader compilation stutter*. This "
"occurs when a shader needs to be compiled when a new material or particle "
"effect is spawned for the first time in a game. This kind of stuttering "
"generally only happens on the first playthrough, or after a graphics driver "
"update when the shader cache is invalidated."
msgstr ""
"另一個常見原因是 *著色器編譯卡頓*。當遊戲中首次出現新的材質或粒子效果時, 需要"
"編譯對應的著色器, 便可能造成卡頓。這類卡頓通常只會在第一次遊玩時發生, 或在顯"
"示卡驅動更新後 (著色器快取失效) 再次出現。"

msgid ""
"Since Godot 4.4, when using the Forward+ or Mobile renderers, the engine "
"tries to avoid shader compilation stutter using an ubershader approach. For "
"this approach to be most effective, care must be taken when designing scenes "
"and resources so that Godot can gather as much information as possible when "
"the scene/resource is loaded, as opposed as to when it's being drawn for the "
"first time. See :ref:`doc_pipeline_compilations` for more information."
msgstr ""
"自 Godot 4.4 起，在使用 Forward+ 或 Mobile 渲染器時，引擎會採用「超級著色器 "
"(ubershader)」的方式來盡量避免著色器編譯卡頓。為了讓此方法更有效，你需要在設"
"計場景與資源時，使 Godot 能在場景/資源載入時就蒐集到盡可能多的資訊，而非等到"
"第一次繪製時才取得。詳情請參閱 :ref:`doc_pipeline_compilations`。"

msgid ""
"However, when using the Compatibility renderer, it is not possible to use "
"this ubershader approach due to technical limitations in OpenGL. Therefore, "
"to avoid shader compilation stutter in the Compatibility renderer, you need "
"to spawn every mesh and visual effect in front of the camera for a single "
"frame when the level is loading. This will ensure the shader is compiled "
"when the level is loaded, as opposed to occurring during gameplay. This can "
"be done behind solid 2D UI (such as a fullscreen :ref:`class_ColorRect` "
"node) so that it's not visible to the player."
msgstr ""
"然而，由於 OpenGL 的技術限制，在 Compatibility 渲染器中無法使用 ubershader 的"
"作法。因此，若要避免 Compatibility 渲染器的著色器編譯卡頓，就需要在關卡載入"
"時，將所有網格與視覺效果在鏡頭前生成一個影格，以確保著色器在關卡載入期間就被"
"編譯完畢，而不是在遊戲進行中才發生。你可以在實心的 2D 介面後面執行這個步驟"
"（例如全螢幕的 :ref:`class_ColorRect` 節點），以免玩家看到。"

msgid ""
"On platforms that support disabling V-Sync, stuttering can be made less "
"noticeable by disabling V-Sync in the project settings. This will however "
"cause tearing to appear, especially on monitors with low refresh rates. If "
"your monitor supports it, consider enabling variable refresh rate (G-Sync/"
"FreeSync) while leaving V-Sync enabled. This allows mitigating some forms of "
"stuttering without introducing tearing. However, it will not help with large "
"stutters, such as the ones caused by shader compilation stutter."
msgstr ""
"在支援關閉垂直同步（V-Sync）的平台上，可以在專案設定中停用 V-Sync 以降低卡頓"
"感受，但這會導致畫面撕裂，特別是在低刷新率的螢幕上。若螢幕支援，建議啟用可變"
"更新率（G-Sync/FreeSync），同時保留 V-Sync 開啟。這能在不引入撕裂的情況下緩解"
"某些形式的卡頓。不過，這對於大型卡頓（例如著色器編譯引起的卡頓）並沒有幫助。"

msgid ""
"Forcing your graphics card to use the maximum performance profile can also "
"help reduce stuttering, at the cost of increased GPU power draw."
msgstr "強制顯示卡使用最高效能設定檔也能減少卡頓，但會增加 GPU 耗電。"

msgid ""
"Additionally, stutter may be induced by the underlying operating system. "

msgstr "Windows"

msgid ""
"Windows is known to cause stutter in windowed games. This mostly depends on "
"the hardware installed, drivers version and processes running in parallel "
"(e.g. having many browser tabs open may cause stutter in a running game). To "
"avoid this, Godot raises the game priority to \"Above Normal\". This helps "
"considerably, but may not completely eliminate stutter."
msgstr ""
"在 Windows 上，視窗化遊戲容易發生卡頓。情況多半與硬體、驅動版本及同時執行的程"

msgid ""
"Eliminating this completely requires giving your game full privileges to "
"become \"Time Critical\", which is not advised. Some games may do it, but it "
"is advised to learn to live with this problem, as it is common for Windows "
"games and most users won't play games windowed (games that are played in a "

msgid ""
"For fullscreen, Windows gives special priority to the game so stutter is no "
"longer visible and very rare. This is how most games are played."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Fullscreen** is meant to be used by GUI applications that want to use per-"
"pixel transparency without a risk of having it disabled by the OS. It "

msgid ""
"When using the Forward+ or Mobile rendering methods, another way to reduce "
"visual latency when V-Sync is enabled is to use double-buffered V-Sync "
"instead of the default triple-buffered V-Sync. Since Godot 4.3, this can be "
"achieved by reducing the **Display > Window > V-Sync > Swapchain Image "
"Count** project setting to ``2``.  The downside of using double buffering is "
"that framerate will be less stable if the display refresh rate can't be "
"reached due to a CPU or GPU bottleneck. For instance, on a 60 Hz display, if "
"the framerate would normally drop to 55 FPS during gameplay with triple "
"buffering, it will have to drop down to 30 FPS momentarily with double "
"buffering (and then go back to 60 FPS when possible). As a result, double-"
"buffered V-Sync is only recommended if you can *consistently* reach the "
"display refresh rate on the target hardware."
msgstr ""
"當使用 Forward+ 或 Mobile 算繪模式時，若已啟用 V-Sync，還能進一步透過「雙緩"
"衝」取代預設的「三緩衝」來降低視覺延遲。自 Godot 4.3 起，可將 **Display > "
"Window > V-Sync > Swapchain Image Count** 專案設定調整為 ``2`` 即啟用雙緩衝。"
"不過，雙緩衝在無法達到螢幕刷新率時（如 CPU/GPU 效能不足），幀率會變得不穩定。"
"例如 60 Hz 螢幕下，若三緩衝時遊戲幀率約 55 FPS，雙緩衝則會瞬間降到 30 FPS，然"

"Increasing the number of physics iterations per second can also reduce "

"runtime in a script. Values that are a multiple of the monitor refresh rate "
"(typically ``60``) work best when physics interpolation is disabled, as they "

msgstr ""
"提升每秒物理計算次數同樣能降低物理相關的輸入延遲。這在啟用物理內插（即提升平"

"The downside of increasing physics FPS is that CPU usage will increase, "
"which can lead to performance bottlenecks in games that have heavy physics "
"simulation code. This can be alleviated by increasing physics FPS only in "
"situations where low latency is critical, or by letting players adjust "
"physics FPS to match their hardware. However, different physics FPS will "
"lead to different outcomes in physics simulation, even when ``delta`` is "
"consistently used in your game logic. This can give certain players an "
"advantage over others. Therefore, allowing the player to change the physics "
"FPS themselves should be avoided for competitive multiplayer games."
msgstr ""
"但增加物理幀率會提升 CPU 使用率，對於物理運算量大的遊戲可能造成效能瓶頸。您可"
"選擇僅在低延遲至關重要時提高物理幀率，或讓玩家依硬體調整。不過，即便您的邏輯"

msgid ""
"Lastly, you can disable input buffering on a per-rendered frame basis by "
"calling ``Input.set_use_accumulated_input(false)`` in a script. This will "
"make it so the ``_input()`` and ``_unhandled_input()`` functions in your "
