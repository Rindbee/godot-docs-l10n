"Godot's Node class provides virtual functions you can override to update "
"nodes every frame or on specific events, like when they enter the scene tree."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的 Node 類提供了虛函式，你可以通過覆蓋虛函式來在每影格或發生特定事件時"
"更新節點，比如進入場景樹時。"

msgid "This document presents the ones you'll use most often."
msgstr "本文件中會展示你會經常用到的那些。"

"Under the hood, these functions rely on Godot's low-level notifications "
"system. To learn more about it, see :ref:`doc_godot_notifications`."
msgstr ""
"這些函式在引擎內部會依賴 Godot 的底層通知系統。要瞭解相關學習，請參閱 :ref:"
"`doc_godot_notifications`。"

msgid ""
"When the node enters the Scene Tree, it becomes active and the engine calls "
"its ``_enter_tree()`` method. That node's children may not be part of the "
"active scene yet. As you can remove and re-add nodes to the scene tree, this "
"function may be called multiple times throughout a node's lifetime."
msgstr ""
"節點進入場景樹時就會被啟動，引擎會呼叫其 ``_enter_tree()`` 方法。該節點的子項"
"可能還不是活動場景的一部分。因為你可以從場景樹中移除節點然後重新新增，在一個"
"節點的生命期中，這個函式可能會被呼叫多次。"

"The two virtual methods ``_process()`` and ``_physics_process()`` allow you "
"to update the node, every frame and every physics frame respectively. For "
"more information, read the dedicated documentation: :ref:"
"`doc_idle_and_physics_processing`."
msgstr ""
"虛函式 ``_process()`` 和 ``_physics_process()`` 可以分別用來對節點進行每影格"
