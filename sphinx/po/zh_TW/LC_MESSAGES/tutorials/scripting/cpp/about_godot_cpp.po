"They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The "
"one you should choose depends on your needs."
msgstr ""
"這兩者也都能將第三方函式庫整合進 Godot。你該選哪一種方式，取決於你的需求。"

msgstr "此外："

msgid "Advantages of C++ modules"
msgstr "C++ 模組的優點"

msgid ""
"C++ modules provide deeper integration into the engine. GDExtension's access "
"is not as deep as static modules."
msgstr "C++ 模組可以與引擎有更深度的整合。GDExtension 的存取層級不如靜態模組。"

msgid ""
"You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without "
"carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."
msgstr ""
"你可以透過 C++ 模組為專案加入額外功能，不必攜帶原生函式庫檔案。這同樣適用於匯"
"出的專案。"

msgid "Version compatibility"
msgstr "版本相容性"

msgid ""
"For this reason, when creating GDExtensions, you may want to target the "
"lowest version of Godot that has the features you need, *not* the most "
"recent version of Godot. This can save you from needing to create multiple "
"builds for different versions of Godot."
msgstr ""
"因此，在開發 GDExtension 時，建議以支援你所需功能的最低 Godot 版本為目標，而"
"非最新版本。如此可避免為不同 Godot 版本重複建置多份函式庫。"

msgid ""
"GDExtensions are also only compatible with engine builds that use the same "
"level of floating-point precision the extension was compiled for. This means "
"that if you use an engine build with double-precision floats, the extension "
"must also be compiled for double-precision floats and use an "
"``extension_api.json`` file generated by your custom engine build. "
"See :ref:`doc_large_world_coordinates` for details."
msgstr ""
"GDExtension 也僅支援與其編譯時浮點精度相同的引擎版本。也就是說，如果你使用的"
"是雙精度浮點（double precision）引擎，GDExtension 也必須用雙精度建置，並且必"
"須使用你自訂引擎版本所產生的 ``extension_api.json``。詳情請參"
"考 :ref:`doc_large_world_coordinates`。"

msgid ""
"Generally speaking, if you build a custom version of Godot, you should "
"generate an ``extension_api.json`` from it for your GDExtensions, because it "
"may have some differences from official Godot builds."
msgstr ""
"一般來說，如果你有自訂 Godot 引擎版本，建議使用該版本產生一份 "
"``extension_api.json`` 來給你的 GDExtension 使用，因為這可能與官方版本有細微"
"差異。"
