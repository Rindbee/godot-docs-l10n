"Groups in Godot work like tags in other software. You can add a node to as "
"many groups as you want. Then, in code, you can use the SceneTree to:"
msgstr ""
"Godot 中的群組與其他軟體中的標籤類似。你可以將節點加入任意數量的你想要的群組"
"之中。然後在程式碼中，你可以使用 SceneTree 來："

msgid "Get a list of nodes in a group."
msgstr "獲取某個群組中的節點列表。"

msgid "Call a method on all nodes in a group."
msgstr "在群組中的所有節點上呼叫方法。"

msgid "Send a notification to all nodes in a group."
msgstr "向群組中的所有節點發送通知。"

msgid "This is a useful feature to organize large scenes and decouple code."
msgstr "這個功能可以用來組織大型場景、對程式碼解耦。"

msgid "Managing groups"
msgstr "管理群組"

msgid ""
"Groups are created by adding a node to a new group name, and likewise they "
"are removed by removing all nodes from a given group."
msgstr ""
"將節點新增到一個新的群組名稱中即可建立群組，同樣的，將所有節點移出某個給定的"
"群組即為移除群組。"

msgid "There are two ways to add/remove nodes to groups:"
msgstr "Godot 沒有使用限制"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"During design, by using the Node dock in the editor, or the Global Groups in "
"project settings."
msgstr "執行編輯器"

msgid ""
"During execution, by calling :ref:`Node.add_to_group() "
"<class_Node_method_add_to_group>` or :ref:`Node.remove_from_group() "
"<class_Node_method_remove_from_group>`."
msgstr ""
"運作時，呼叫 :ref:`Node.add_to_group() <class_Node_method_add_to_group>` 或 :"
"ref:`Node.remove_from_group() <class_Node_method_remove_from_group>`。"

msgid "Using the Node dock"
msgstr "使用模組"

#, fuzzy
msgid "You can create new groups using the Groups tab in the Node dock."
msgstr "你可以使用“節點”停靠面板中的“群組”分頁，將目前場景中的節點加進群組中。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Select one or more nodes in the Scene dock then click the add button with "
"the + symbol."
msgstr ""
"在“場景”面板中選中若干個節點，在輸入框中填寫群組名稱，然後按一下“新增”。"

msgid ""
"You should now see the Create New Group modal appear. Write the group name "
"in the field."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can optionally mark the option \"Global\", which will make the group "
"visible project-wide, and able to be reused in any project scene. This will "
"also allow you to give it a description."
msgstr ""

msgid "When done, press Ok to create it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should see the new groups appear in the Groups tab under Scene Groups if "
"the Global option was unmarked, or under Global Groups if that option was "
"marked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Selected Node(s) from the Scene dock can be added into groups by marking the "
"checkbox on the left side of the groups in the Groups dock. The node(s) you "
"had selected when creating a new group will be automatically checked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"All groups present in the project that were marked as Global, created from "
"any scene, will be visible under Global Groups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Any other group derived from nodes in the current scene will appear under "
"Scene Groups."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The same underlying logic is used for both Global and Scene groups. Groups "
"with the same name are considered one and the same. This feature is purely "
"organizational."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can manage Global Groups in the Global Groups dock, inside Project "
"Settings. There, you will be able to add new global groups, or change "
"existing groups' names and descriptions."
msgstr ""

msgid "Using code"
msgstr "使用空白字元"

msgid ""
"You can also manage groups from scripts. The following code adds the node to "
"which you attach the script to the ``guards`` group as soon as it enters the "
"scene tree."
msgstr ""
"第二種方法則是使用程式碼。下面這個腳本會在目前節點一進入場景樹後立刻把它新增"
"到 ``enemies`` (敵人) 群組中。"

msgid ""
"Imagine you're creating an infiltration game. When an enemy spots the "
"player, you want all guards and robots to be on alert."
msgstr ""
"請想像你正在製作潛入類遊戲。敵人發現玩家後，你會希望所有守衛和機器人都進入警"
"覺狀態。"

msgid ""
"In the fictional example below, we use ``SceneTree.call_group()`` to alert "
"all enemies that the player was spotted."
msgstr ""
"下面的虛擬例子中，我們使用 ``SceneTree.call_group()`` 來通知所有敵人，玩家被"
"發現了。"

msgid ""
"The above code calls the function ``enter_alert_mode`` on every member of "
"the group ``guards``."
msgstr ""
"上面的程式碼會呼叫群組 ``enemies`` 裡所有成員的 ``player_was_discovered`` 方"
"法。"

msgid ""
"To get the full list of nodes in the ``guards`` group as an array, you can "
"call :ref:`SceneTree.get_nodes_in_group() "
"<class_SceneTree_method_get_nodes_in_group>`:"
msgstr ""
"另外，也可以通過呼叫 :ref:`SceneTree.get_nodes_in_group() "
"<class_SceneTree_method_get_nodes_in_group>` 來取得所有 ``enemies`` 群組下的"
"節點："

msgid ""
"The :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` class provides many more useful "
"methods to interact with scenes, their node hierarchy, and groups. It allows "
"you to switch scenes easily or reload them, quit the game or pause and "
"unpause it. It also provides useful signals."
msgstr ""
":ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` 類別還提供了很多實用的方法，例如與場景、節"
"點架構、群組等互動。也可以使用 SceneTree 來輕鬆切換場景、重新載入場景、結束遊"
"戲、暫停以及取消暫停。SceneTree 甚至有一些很有趣的訊號。有空的話記得去看看 "
"SceneTree 的手冊。"
