msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"As explained in the :ref:`doc_debugger_panel` documentation, Godot features "
"a **Debugger > Monitors** bottom panel that allows tracking various values "
"with graphs showing their evolution over time. The data for those graphs is "
"sourced from the engine's :ref:`class_Performance` singleton."
msgstr ""
"如 :ref:`doc_debugger_panel` 說明，Godot 提供下方 **除錯器 > 效能監控** 分"
"頁，可透過圖表追蹤各項數值隨時間變化。這些數據來自引擎"
"的 :ref:`class_Performance` 單例物件。"

msgid ""
"Since Godot 4.0, you can declare custom values to be displayed in the "
"Monitors tab. Example use cases for custom performance monitors include:"
msgstr "自 Godot 4.0 起，你可自訂在效能監控分頁顯示的任意數值。常見用途包括："

msgid ""
"Displaying performance metrics that are specific to your project. For "
"instance, in a voxel game, you could create a performance monitor to track "
"the number of chunks that are loaded every second."
msgstr "顯示專案特有的效能指標。例如體素遊戲可追蹤每秒載入的區塊數量。"

msgid ""
"Displaying in-game metrics that are not strictly related to performance, but "
"are still useful to graph for debugging purposes. For instance, you could "
"track the number of enemies present in the game to make sure your spawning "
"mechanic works as intended."
msgstr ""
"記錄與效能無關但有助於除錯的遊戲指標。例如追蹤場上敵人數，檢查敵人產生機制是"
"否正常。"

msgid "Creating a custom performance monitor"
msgstr "建立自訂效能監控"

msgid ""
"In this example, we'll create a custom performance monitor to track how many "
"enemies are present in the currently running project."
msgstr "本範例將建立一個自訂效能監控，追蹤當前專案中的敵人數量。"

msgid ""
"The main scene features a :ref:`class_Timer` node with the following script "
"attached:"
msgstr "主場景中有一個 :ref:`class_Timer` 節點，附加以下腳本："

msgid ""
"The second parameter "
"of :ref:`Performance.add_custom_monitor<class_Performance_method_add_custom_monitor>` "
"is a :ref:`class_Callable`."
msgstr ""
":ref:`Performance.add_custom_monitor<class_Performance_method_add_custom_monitor>` "
"的第二個參數為 :ref:`class_Callable`。"

msgid ""
"``enemy.tscn`` is a scene with a Node2D root node and Timer child node. The "
"Node2D has the following script attached:"
msgstr ""
"``enemy.tscn`` 是一個擁有 Node2D 根節點與 Timer 子節點的場景，Node2D 節點附有"
"如下腳本："

msgid ""
"In this example, since we spawn 20 enemies per second, and each enemy "
"despawns 2.5 seconds after they spawn, we expect the number of enemies "
"present in the scene to stabilize to 50. We can make sure about this by "
"looking at the graph."
msgstr ""
"本例中，每秒產生 20 名敵人，每名敵人存活 2.5 秒，理論上場景內敵人數將穩定於 "
"50。可透過監控圖表驗證此數值。"

msgid ""
"To visualize the graph created from this custom performance monitor, run the "
"project, switch to the editor while the project is running and open "
"**Debugger > Monitors** at the bottom of the editor window. Scroll down to "
"the newly available **Game** section and check **Enemies**. You should see a "
"graph appearing as follows:"
msgstr ""
"要檢視自訂效能監控的圖表，執行專案後切回編輯器，於下方 **除錯器 > 效能監控** "
"分頁中，捲動至新出現的 **遊戲** 分類，勾選 **敵人**，即可看到如下圖表："

msgid "Example editor graph from a custom performance monitor"
msgstr "自訂效能監控於編輯器內的圖表示例"

msgid ""
"The performance monitor handling code doesn't have to live in the same "
"script as the nodes themselves. You may choose to move the performance "
"monitor registration and getter function to an :ref:`autoload "
"<doc_singletons_autoload>` instead."
msgstr ""
"效能監控相關程式碼不一定要寫在節點自身腳本內。也可將註冊與取值函式移"
"到 :ref:`autoload <doc_singletons_autoload>` 中集中管理。"

msgid "Querying a performance monitor in a project"
msgstr "於專案中查詢效能監控數值"

msgid ""
"If you wish to display the value of the performance monitor in the running "
"project's window (rather than the editor), use "
"``Performance.get_custom_monitor(\"category/name\")`` to fetch the value of "
"the custom monitor. You can display the value using "
"a :ref:`class_Label`, :ref:`class_RichTextLabel`, :ref:`doc_custom_drawing_in_2d`, :ref:`doc_3d_text`, "
"etc."
msgstr ""
"若你想在遊戲視窗（非編輯器）顯示監控數值，可用 "
"``Performance.get_custom_monitor(\"分類/名稱\")`` 讀取。可"
"用 :ref:`class_Label`、:ref:`class_RichTextLabel`、:ref:`doc_custom_drawing_in_2d`、:ref:`doc_3d_text` "
"等方式顯示。"

msgid ""
"This method can be used in exported projects as well (debug and release "
"mode), which allows you to create visualizations outside the editor."
msgstr ""
"此方法可用於匯出專案（除錯與發行模式），讓你在編輯器外也能顯示自訂效能圖表。"
