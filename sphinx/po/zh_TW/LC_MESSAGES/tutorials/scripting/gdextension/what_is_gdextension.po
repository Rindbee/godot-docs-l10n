msgid "What is GDExtension?"
msgstr "什麼是GDExtension？"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"GDExtension is *not* a scripting language and has no relation to :ref:"
"`GDScript <doc_gdscript>`."
msgstr "GDExtension *不是*指令碼語言，與 :ref:`GDScript <doc_gdscript>` 無關。"

msgid "Differences between GDExtension and C++ modules"
msgstr "GDExtension 與 C++ 模組的區別"

msgid ""
"You can use both GDExtension and :ref:`C++ modules "
"<doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` to run C or C++ code in a Godot project."
msgstr ""
"支援將 :ref:`C++ 模組 <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` 靜態連結到引擎二進位檔中。"

msgid ""
"They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The "
"one you should choose depends on your needs."
msgstr "它們都可以用來將協力廠商庫集成進 Godot。選用哪一個取決於你的需求。"

msgid "Advantages of GDExtension"
msgstr "GDExtension 的優點"

msgid ""
"Unlike modules, GDExtension doesn't require compiling the engine's source "
"code, making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most "
"of the API available to GDScript and C#, allowing you to code game logic "
"with full control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-"
"performance code you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset "
"library <doc_what_is_assetlib>`."
msgstr ""
"與模組不同，GDNative 不需要編譯引擎的源碼，可以使你的作品更易於分發。它可以讓"
"你存取 GDScript、C# 使用的大多數 API，讓你在編寫遊戲邏輯時能夠完全控制性能。"
"這是你在:ref:`素材庫 <doc_what_is_assetlib>`中以外掛程式形式分發高性能程式碼"
"的理想選擇。"

msgid "Also:"
msgstr "並且："

msgid ""
"GDExtension is not limited to C and C++. Thanks to :ref:`third-party "
"bindings <doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, you can use it with "
"many other languages."
msgstr ""
"GDExtension 並不僅限於 C 和 C++。得益於:ref:`協力廠商綁定 "
"<doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`，你也可以在很多其他語言中使用。"

msgid ""
"GDExtension only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. "
"That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. "
"Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with "
"incremental builds, this process is slower than using GDExtension."
msgstr ""
"GDNative 只需編譯你自己的庫，而不是整個引擎。C++ 模組則與此不同，是會靜態編譯"
"進引擎的。每修改一次模組，你就需要重新編譯一次引擎。即使使用差異量建構，這一"
"過程也比 GDNative 要慢。"

msgid "Advantages of C++ modules"
msgstr "C++ 模組的優點"

msgid ""
"We recommend :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` in cases where "
"GDExtension isn't enough:"
msgstr ""
"支援將 :ref:`C++ 模組 <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` 靜態連結到引擎二進位檔中。"

msgid ""
"You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without "
"carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."
msgstr ""
"使用 C++ 模組為專案提供額外功能，就可以免去攜帶原生庫檔的麻煩。同樣也適用於匯"
"出的專案。"

msgid "Supported languages"
msgstr "支援的圖片格式"

msgid ""
"The Godot developers officially support the following language bindings for "
"GDExtension:"
msgstr "Godot 開發者官方支援以下 GDExtension 語言綁定："

msgid "C++ :ref:`(tutorial) <doc_gdextension_cpp_example>`"
msgstr ":ref:`doc_input_examples`"

msgid ""
"There are no plans to support additional languages with GDExtension "
"officially. That said, the community offers several bindings for other "
"languages (see below)."
msgstr ""
"沒有官方支援更多 GDNative 語言的計畫。不過社區提供了不少其他語言的綁定（見下"
"文）。"

msgid "The bindings below are developed and maintained by the community:"
msgstr "以下綁定是由社區開發並維護的："

msgid ""
"Not all bindings mentioned here may be production-ready. Make sure to "
"research options thoroughly before starting a project with one of those. "
"Also, double-check whether the binding is compatible with the Godot version "
"you're using."
msgstr ""
"這裡列出的綁定並不都能用於生產。請在新專案中使用前先做足調查。同時，請確定該"
"綁定與你所使用的 Godot 版本相容。"

msgid "Version compatibility"
msgstr "版本相容性"

msgid ""
"However, GDExtension is currently *experimental*, which means that we may "
"break compatibility in order to fix major bugs or include critical features. "
"For example, GDExtensions created for Godot 4.0 aren't compatible with Godot "
"4.1 (see :ref:`updating_your_gdextension_for_godot_4_1`)."
msgstr ""
"然而，GDExtension 目前處於*實驗階段*，這意味著我們可能會破壞相容性以修復主要"
"錯誤或包含關鍵功能。例如，為 Godot 4.0 建立的 GDExtension 與 Godot 4.1 不相容"
"（請參閱:ref:`updating_your_gdextension_for_godot_4_1`）。"
