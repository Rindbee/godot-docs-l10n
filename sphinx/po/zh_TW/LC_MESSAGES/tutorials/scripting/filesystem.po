msgid "File system"
msgstr "檔案系統"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"A file system manages how assets are stored and how they are accessed. A "
"well-designed file system also allows multiple developers to edit the same "
"source files and assets while collaborating. Godot stores all assets as "
"files in its file system."
msgstr ""
"檔案系統管理素材的儲存與存取方式。設計良好的檔案系統也能讓多位開發者在協作時"
"共同編輯相同的原始檔與素材。Godot 會將所有素材存為檔案於自身檔案系統中。"

msgid "Implementation"
msgstr "實作"

msgid ""
"The file system stores resources on disk. Anything, from a script, to a "
"scene or a PNG image is a resource to the engine. If a resource contains "
"properties that reference other resources on disk, the paths to those "
"resources are also included. If a resource has sub-resources that are built-"
"in, the resource is saved in a single file together with all the bundled sub-"
"resources. For example, a font resource is often bundled together with the "
"font textures."
msgstr ""
"檔案系統會將資源儲存在硬碟上。對引擎來說，無論是腳本、場景還是 PNG 圖片，都是"
"一種資源。若資源包含指向硬碟上其他資源的屬性，也會將該資源的路徑一併保存。如"
"果資源有內建的子資源，則會將資源與所有子資源一起儲存於同一個檔案中。例如，字"
"型資源通常會與字型貼圖一同打包。"

msgid ""
"The Godot file system avoids using metadata files. Existing asset managers "
"and VCSs are better than anything we can implement, so Godot tries its best "
"to play along with Subversion, Git, Mercurial, etc."
msgstr ""
"Godot 的檔案系統避免使用中繼資料（Metadata）檔案。現有的素材管理工具與版本控"
"制系統（VCS）都比我們自己開發的更優秀，因此 Godot 盡可能與 SVN、Git、"
"Mercurial 等系統配合運作。"

msgid "Example of file system contents:"
msgstr "檔案系統內容範例："

msgid "project.godot"
msgstr "project.godot"

msgid ""
"The ``project.godot`` file is the project description file, and it is always "
"found at the root of the project. In fact, its location defines where the "
"root is. This is the first file that Godot looks for when opening a project."
msgstr ""
"``project.godot`` 是專案描述檔，必定位於專案根目錄。而其所在位置也定義了專案"
"根目錄的位置。Godot 開啟專案時會優先尋找這個檔案。"

msgid ""
"This file contains the project configuration in plain text, using the "
"win.ini format. Even an empty ``project.godot`` can function as a basic "
"definition of a blank project."
msgstr ""
"此檔案以純文字（win.ini 格式）儲存專案設定。即使是空白的 ``project.godot``，"
"也能作為空專案的基本定義。"

msgid "Path delimiter"
msgstr "路徑分隔符號"

msgid ""
"Godot only supports ``/`` as a path delimiter. This is done for portability "
"reasons. All operating systems support this, even Windows, so a path such as "
"``C:\\project\\project.godot`` needs to be typed as ``C:/project/"
"project.godot``."
msgstr ""
"Godot 只支援 ``/`` 作為路徑分隔符號。這樣設計是為了提升跨平台相容性。所有作業"
"系統，包括 Windows，都支援此寫法，因此原本的 ``C:\\project\\project.godot`` "
"必須寫成 ``C:/project/project.godot``。"

msgid "Resource path"
msgstr "資源路徑"

msgid ""
"When accessing resources, using the host OS file system layout can be "
"cumbersome and non-portable. To solve this problem, the special path ``res://"
"`` was created."
msgstr ""
"在存取資源時，若直接使用作業系統的檔案系統路徑會顯得繁瑣且缺乏可移植性。為了"
"解決這個問題，Godot 設計了特殊路徑 ``res://``。"

msgid ""
"The path ``res://`` will always point at the project root (where "
"``project.godot`` is located, so ``res://project.godot`` is always valid)."
msgstr ""
"``res://`` 路徑永遠指向專案根目錄（即 ``project.godot`` 所在處，因此 ``res://"
"project.godot`` 始終是有效的）。"

msgid ""
"This file system is read-write only when running the project locally from "
"the editor. When exported or when running on different devices (such as "
"phones or consoles, or running from DVD), the file system will become read-"
"only and writing will no longer be permitted."
msgstr ""
"當專案於編輯器內執行時，檔案系統為可讀寫模式。當專案匯出或於其他裝置（如手"
"機、主機、或從 DVD 執行）運行時，檔案系統則會變為唯讀，無法寫入。"

msgid "User path"
msgstr "使用者路徑"

msgid ""
"Writing to disk is still needed for tasks such as saving game state or "
"downloading content packs. To this end, the engine ensures that there is a "
"special path ``user://`` that is always writable. This path resolves "
"differently depending on the OS the project is running on. Local path "
"resolution is further explained in :ref:`doc_data_paths`."
msgstr ""
"像是保存遊戲進度或下載擴充內容等情境，仍需寫入硬碟。為此，Godot 引擎保證有一"
"個永遠可寫入的特殊路徑 ``user://``。此路徑會依專案運行的作業系統而有所不同。"
"關於本機路徑解析，詳見 :ref:`doc_data_paths`。"

msgid "Host file system"
msgstr "主機檔案系統"

msgid ""
"Alternatively host file system paths can also be used, but this is not "
"recommended for a released product as these paths are not guaranteed to work "
"on all platforms. However, using host file system paths can be useful when "
"writing development tools in Godot."
msgstr ""
"你也可以直接使用主機檔案系統的路徑，但不建議於發佈正式產品時採用，因這些路徑"
"無法保證在所有平台運作。不過在 Godot 裡開發工具時，這樣做會很方便。"

msgid "Drawbacks"
msgstr "缺點"

msgid ""
"There are some drawbacks to this file system design. The first issue is that "
"moving assets around (renaming them or moving them from one path to another "
"inside the project) will break existing references to these assets. These "
"references will have to be re-defined to point at the new asset location."
msgstr ""
"這種檔案系統設計仍有一些缺點。第一，在專案內移動素材（重新命名或更改路徑）"
"時，現有的參照會失效，必須重新指定這些參照的路徑。"

msgid ""
"To avoid this, do all your move, delete and rename operations from within "
"Godot, on the FileSystem dock. Never move assets from outside Godot, or "
"dependencies will have to be fixed manually (Godot detects this and helps "
"you fix them anyway, but why go the hard route?)."
msgstr ""
"為避免這類問題，請務必在 Godot 的檔案系統 Dock 裡進行所有移動、刪除或重新命名"
"操作。切勿在 Godot 以外的地方移動素材，否則依賴關係就得自己手動修正（雖然 "
"Godot 會協助偵測並修復，但何苦自找麻煩呢？）。"

msgid ""
"The second is that, under Windows and macOS, file and path names are case "
"insensitive. If a developer working in a case insensitive host file system "
"saves an asset as ``myfile.PNG``, but then references it as ``myfile.png``, "
"it will work fine on their platform, but not on other platforms, such as "
"Linux, Android, etc. This may also apply to exported binaries, which use a "
"compressed package to store all files."
msgstr ""
"其次，在 Windows 與 macOS 系統下，檔案與路徑名稱不區分大小寫。若開發者將素材"
"儲存為 ``myfile.PNG``，卻以 ``myfile.png`` 參照，在這些系統上雖能正常運作，但"
"在 Linux、Android 等區分大小寫的平台上就會出錯。這情況也適用於匯出時以壓縮封"
"包儲存檔案的情境。"

msgid ""
"It is recommended that your team clearly define a naming convention for "
"files when working with Godot. One fool-proof convention is to only allow "
"lowercase file and path names."
msgstr ""
"建議團隊在使用 Godot 時，明訂檔案命名規範。最簡單保險的方法，就是僅允許檔案與"
"路徑名稱使用小寫字母。"
