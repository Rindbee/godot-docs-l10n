"Let's start with basics, and learn how to get Godot's source code, and then "
"which options to use to compile it regardless of your target platform."

"让我们从基础开始，学习如何获取 Godot 的源代码，然后使用哪些选项来进行编译，任"

"Below you can find instructions for compiling the engine for your specific "
"target platform. Note that Godot supports cross-compilation, which means you "
"can compile it for a target platform that doesn't match your current "
"platform (say, target Linux while being on Windows). The guides will try "
"their best to cover all possible situations."
msgstr ""
"你可以在下面找到针对特定目标平台编译引擎的说明。请注意，Godot 支持交叉编译，"
"也就是说你可以将其编译到与当前平台不匹配的目标平台（例如在 Windows 平台上以 "
"Linux 平台作为目标平台）。本指南将尽力涵盖所有可能的情况。"

msgid "Other compilation targets and options"
msgstr "其他构建目标和选项"

msgid ""
"Some additional universal compilation options require further setup. Namely, "
"while Godot does have C#/.NET support as a part of its main codebase, it "
"does not get compiled by default to reduce the executable size for users who "
"don't need C# for their projects."
msgstr ""
"还有一些通用的编译选项是需要额外设置的。比如虽然 Godot 的主代码库支持 C#/."
"NET，但默认情况下不会对其进行编译，这样减小了项目中用不到 C# 的用户的可执行文"
"件大小。"

msgid ""
"Articles below explain how to configure the buildsystem for cases like this, "
"and also cover some optimization techniques."
