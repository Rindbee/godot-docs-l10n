"**A feature doesn't exist unless it is documented**. If a user can't find "

"If the page assumes specific knowledge of other Godot features, mention it "
"and link to the corresponding documentation. For instance, a page about "
"physics may use signals, in which case you could note that the signals "
"tutorial is a prerequisite. You may also link to other websites for "
"prerequisites beyond the documentation's scope. For example, you could link "
"to an introduction to programming in the getting started guide, or a website "
"that teaches math theory in the math section."

"如果某个页面假设读者了解引擎的另一项功能，请在开头给出相关介绍以及能够为用户"

"Programming fundamentals are a prerequisite for using a complex engine like "
"Godot. Talking about variables, functions, or classes is acceptable. But we "
"should favor plain language over specific terminology like "
"\"metaprogramming\". If you need to use precise terms, be sure to define "
"them."
