"**Write a complete reference manual**. Our goal here is not to teach "

"how Godot's features work."

"Below are the guidelines we should strive to follow. They are not hard "
"rules, though: sometimes, a topic will require breaking one or more of them. "
"Still, we should strive to achieve the two goals listed above."

"以下是我们应该努力遵守的规范。不过这些并不是硬性规定：特殊情况下，某个主题会"
"需要打破这里的若干规范。不过我们还是应该尽量完成上面所列出的两个目标。"

msgid "Writing complete and accessible documentation"
msgstr "编写完善易懂的文档"

msgid ""
"**A feature doesn't exist unless it is documented**. If a user can't find "
"information about a feature and how it works, it doesn't exist to them. We "
"should ensure that we cover everything Godot does."
msgstr ""
"**功能在编写其文档前是不存在的**\\ 。如果用户无法找到某个功能的信息和用法，那"
"么这个功能对于他们来说就不存在。我们应该保证文档能够涉及到 Godot 的方方面面。"

msgid ""
"When adding or updating an engine feature, the documentation team needs to "
"know about it. Contributors should open an issue on the `godot-docs` "
"repository when their work gets merged and requires documentation."
msgstr ""
"添加或更新引擎的功能时，文档团队应该跟进。工作成果被合并后，如果需要文档，贡"
"献者应该在 `godot-docs` 仓库创建 Issue。"

"Do your best to keep documents **under 1000 words in length**. If a page "
"goes past that threshold, consider splitting it into two parts. Limiting "
"page size forces us to write concisely and to break up large documents so "
"that each page focuses on a particular problem."
msgstr ""
"请竭尽所能将文档保持在\\ **1000 个单词以内**\\ 。如果页面超过了这个阈值，如果"
"可能，请考虑将它拆分成两个部分。对页面的大小作出限制，强制我们在写作时保持简"
"洁，将大段的文档进行拆分可以让每一部分都集中于某个特定的问题。"

msgid ""
"Each page or section of a page should clearly state what **problem** it "
"tackles and what it will teach the user. Users need to know if they're "
"reading the correct guide for solving the problems they're encountering. For "
"example, instead of writing the heading \"Signals\", consider writing "
"\"Reacting to changes with signals\". The second title makes it clear what "
"the purpose of signals is."
msgstr ""
"讲清楚每个页面或章节所针对的\\ **问题**\\ ，以及用户会学到什么。用户需要知道"
"他们看的指南是否能够正确解决他们所遇到的问题。例如，请不要在题目里"
"写“Signals”（信号），请考虑写“Reacting to changes with signals”（使用信号对变"
"化作出响应）。后者标明了使用信号的目的。"

msgid ""
"Long section titles lead to long entries in the side menu, which can make "
"navigation cumbersome. Try to keep headings five words long or less."
msgstr ""
"章节标题太长，侧边菜单的项目就会变长，导航也会变得冗长。请尽量让题目保持在五"
"个单词以内。"

msgid ""
"If the page assumes specific knowledge of other Godot features, mention it "
"and link to the corresponding documentation. For instance, a page about "
"physics may use signals, in which case you could note that the signals "
"tutorial is a prerequisite. You may also link to other websites for "
"prerequisites beyond the documentation's scope. For example, you could link "
"to an introduction to programming in the getting started guide, or a website "
"that teaches math theory in the math section."
msgstr ""
"如果某个页面假设读者了解引擎的另一项功能，请在开头给出相关介绍以及能够为用户"
"提供必要信息的文档链接。例如，一个涉及到物理处理的页面可能使用了信号"
"（Signals）功能，在这种情况下你会注意到关于信号的教程是一种前置要求。在给出相"
"关 Godot 文档链接的同时你也同样可以列出来自其他网站的链接。例如，你可以在入门"
"指南中给出编程介绍的章节链接，或者是在数学运算部分给出教授对应数学理论的网站"
"链接。"

msgid "Limiting cognitive load"
msgstr "减少认知负担"

msgid ""
"Limit the cognitive load required to read the documentation. The simpler and "
"more explicit language we use, the more efficient it becomes for people to "
"learn. You can do so by:"

"Including one or more **concrete usage examples**. Prefer a real-world "
"example to one that uses names like ``foo``, ``bar``, or ``baz``."
msgstr ""
"提供若干\\ **实际使用示例**\\ 。现实世界的例子比像 ``foobar`` 一样的抽象代码"
"更好。"

"While many people may understand more complex language and abstract "

"examples benefit everyone."

"Always make an effort to **put yourself in the user's shoes**. When we "
"understand something thoroughly, it becomes obvious to us. We may fail to "
"think about details relevant to a newcomer, but **good documentation meets "
"users where they are**. We should explain each feature's capabilities or "
"intended uses with the most straightforward language possible."
msgstr ""
"始终努力\\ **设身处地为用户着想**\\ 。某件事情如果我们完全理解，对于我们而言"
"就会变得显而易见。我们可能无法想象新手相关的细节，但\\ **好的文档就是要为用户"
"雪中送炭**\\ 。我们应该用尽可能直白的语言，尽力去解释每一个特性的用处或用法。"

"Try to remember what you first needed to know when learning about the "
"feature or concept. What new terms did you need to learn? What confused you? "
"What was the hardest to grasp? You will want users to review your work, and "
"we recommend you practice explaining the feature before writing about it."

"Programming fundamentals are a prerequisite for using a complex engine like "
"Godot. Talking about variables, functions, or classes is acceptable. But we "
"should favor plain language over specific terminology like "
"\"metaprogramming\". If you need to use precise terms, be sure to define "
"them."
msgstr ""
"拥有编程基础是使用像 Godot 这样复杂引擎的前提条件。讨论变量、函数、类是可以接"
"受的，但相对于“元编程”之类的特定术语，我们应该更倾向于使用通俗易懂的语言来表"
"达它们。如果你需要使用精准的术语，请务必通过定义解释它们。"
