"A full tutorial on creating outlines is not provided here, we recommend "

"transparency value like in Inkscape). This color was chosen specifically to "
"make sure color blind people do not have issues reading the documentation, "

"an image are needed, red should be avoided. The second standard is that all "
"outlines and arrow lines should be 2 pixels wide."

"``fffb44ff`` ）。选择这种颜色是为了确保色盲在阅读文档时不会遇到问题，如果需要"

msgid ""
"Finally, some images might require text to differentiate multiple parts of "
"an image. There are no strict requirements other than use an easy to read "
"non fancy font. As for color the yellow color from before should also be "
"used, but black or other colors can be used if appropriate. For example, if "
"yellow blends into the image, or if there are multiple outlines in multiple "
"colors."
msgstr ""
"最后，一些图像可能需要文本来区分图像的多个部分。除了使用易读的非花哨字体外，"
"没有其他严格的要求。至于颜色，也应该使用以前的黄色，但如果合适，可以使用黑色"
"或其他颜色。例如，如果黄色混合到图像中，或者如果存在多种颜色的多个轮廓。"
