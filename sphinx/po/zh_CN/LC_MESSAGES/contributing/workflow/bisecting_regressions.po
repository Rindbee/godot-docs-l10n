"Bisecting is a way to find regressions in software. After reporting a bug on "
"the `Godot repository on GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot>`__, "
"you may be asked by a contributor to *bisect* the issue. Bisecting makes it "
"possible for contributors to fix bugs faster, as they can know in advance "
"which commit caused the regression. Your effort will be widely appreciated :)"

"Godot developers use the `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ version control "
"system. In the context of Git, bisecting is the process of performing a "
"manual `binary search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Binary_search_algorithm>`__ to determine when a regression appeared. While "
"it's typically used for bugs, it can also be used to find other kinds of "
"unexpected changes such as performance regressions."

"Godot开发人员使用 `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ 版本控制系统. 在Git的上下文"
"中, 二等分是执行手动 `二进制搜索 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Binary_search_algorithm>`__ 的过程, 以确定什么时候出现了回归. 尽管它通常用于"
"错误, 但也可以用于查找其他种类的意外更改, 例如性能下降."

msgid "Using official builds to speed up bisecting"

msgid "The Git bisect command"
msgstr "Git bisect 命令"

msgid ""
"If you've found a build that didn't exhibit the bug in the above testing "
"process, you can now start bisecting the regression. The Git version control "
"system offers a built-in command for this: ``git bisect``. This makes the "
"process semi-automated as you only have to build the engine, run it and try "
"to reproduce the bug."
msgstr ""
"如果你发现在上述测试过程中未显示该错误的构建，则可以立即将回归二等分。Git 版"
"本控制系统为此提供了一个内置命令：\\ ``git bisect``\\ 。这使过程成为半自动化"
"的过程，因为你只需要构建引擎，运行它并尝试重现该错误即可。"

"Before bisecting a regression, you need to set up a build environment to "
"compile Godot from source. To do so, read the :ref:`Compiling <toc-devel-"
"compiling>` page for your target platform. (Compiling Godot from source "
"doesn't require C++ programming knowledge.)"

msgid ""
"Note that compiling Godot can take a while on slow hardware (up an hour for "
"each full rebuild on a slow dual-core CPU). This means the full process can "
"take up to several hours. If your hardware is too slow, you may want to stop "
"there and report the results of your \"pre-bisecting\" on the GitHub issue "
"so another contributor can continue bisecting from there."
msgstr ""
"请注意, 编译 Godot 可能需要在缓慢的硬件上一段时间(在缓慢的双核 CPU 上, 每次完"
