msgid "Nodes and Scenes"
msgstr "节点与场景"

msgid ""
"In :ref:`doc_key_concepts_overview`, we saw that a Godot game is a tree of "
"scenes and that each scene is a tree of nodes. In this lesson, we explain a "
"bit more about them. You will also create your first scene."
msgstr ""
"在《\\ :ref:`doc_key_concepts_overview`\\ 》中，我们看到 Godot 游戏就是由场景"
"构成的树状结构，而每一个场景又是一个由节点构成的树状结构。在这一节中，我们将"
"更详细地解释这些概念，你还将创建你的第一个场景。"

msgid "Nodes"
msgstr "节点"

msgid ""
"**Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of your game**. They are like "
"the ingredients in a recipe. There are dozens of kinds that can display an "
"image, play a sound, represent a camera, and much more."
msgstr ""
"**节点是你的游戏的基本构件**\\ 。它们就像食谱里的食材。Godot 引擎包含很多种节"
"点，可以用来显示图像、播放声音、表示摄像机等等。"

msgid "All nodes have the following characteristics:"
msgstr "所有节点都具备以下特性："

msgid "A name."
msgstr "名称。"

msgid "Editable properties."
msgstr "可编辑的属性。"

msgid "They receive callbacks to update every frame."
msgstr "每帧都可以接收回调以进行更新。"

msgid "You can extend them with new properties and functions."
msgstr "你可以使用新的属性和函数来进行扩展。"

msgid "You can add them to another node as a child."
msgstr "你可以将它们添加为其他节点的子节点。"

msgid ""
"The last characteristic is important. **Together, nodes form a tree**, which "
"is a powerful feature to organize projects. Since different nodes have "
"different functions, combining them produces more complex behavior. As we "
"saw before, you can build a playable character the camera follows using "
"a :ref:`CharacterBody2D <class_CharacterBody2D>` node, a :ref:`Sprite2D "
"<class_Sprite2D>` node, a :ref:`Camera2D <class_Camera2D>` node, and "
"a :ref:`CollisionShape2D <class_CollisionShape2D>` node."
msgstr ""
"最后一个特征很重要。\\ **节点会组成一棵树**\\ ，这个功能组织起项目来非常强"
"大。因为不同的节点有不同的功能，将它们组合起来可以产生更复杂的行为。 正如我们"
"之前看到的，你可以用一个 :ref:`CharacterBody2D <class_CharacterBody2D>` 节"
"点、一个 :ref:`Sprite2D <class_Sprite2D>` 节点、一个 :ref:`Camera2D "
"<class_Camera2D>` 节点以及一个 :ref:`CollisionShape2D "
"<class_CollisionShape2D>` 节点来建立一个摄像机跟随的可玩角色。"

msgid "Scenes"
msgstr "场景"

msgid ""
"When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this "
"construct a scene. Once saved, scenes work like new node types in the "
"editor, where you can add them as a child of an existing node. In that case, "
"the instance of the scene appears as a single node with its internals hidden."
msgstr ""
"当你在树中组织节点时，就像我们的角色一样，我们称之为场景构造。保存后，场景的"
"工作方式类似于编辑器中的新节点类型，你可以在其中将它们添加为现有节点的子节"
"点。在这种情况下，场景实例显示为隐藏其内部结构的单个节点。"

msgid ""
"Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You can "
"**compose nodes** to create custom and complex node types, like a game "
"character that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you can "
"interact, and more."
msgstr ""
"场景允许你以你想要的方式来构造你的游戏代码。你可以\\ **组合节点**\\ 来创建自"
"定义和复杂的节点类型，比如能跑能跳的游戏角色、生命条、可以互动的箱子等等。"

msgid ""
"The Godot editor essentially is a **scene editor**. It has plenty of tools "
"for editing 2D and 3D scenes, as well as user interfaces. A Godot project "
"can contain as many of these scenes as you need. The engine only requires "
"one as your application's **main scene**. This is the scene Godot will first "
"load when you or a player runs the game."
msgstr ""
"本质上，Godot 编辑器就是一个\\ **场景编辑器**\\ 。它有很多用于编辑 2D 和 3D "
"场景以及用户界面的工具。Godot 项目中可以包含任意数量的场景。引擎只要求将其中"
"之一设为程序的\\ **主场景**\\ 。这是你或者玩家运行游戏时，Godot 最初加载的场"
"景。"

msgid "On top of acting like nodes, scenes have the following characteristics:"
msgstr "除了像节点一样工作之外，场景还具有以下特点："

msgid "They always have one root node, like the \"Player\" in our example."
msgstr "它们始终有一个根节点，就像我们示例中的“Player”一样。"

msgid "You can save them to your local drive and load them later."
msgstr "你可以将它们保存到本地驱动器并稍后加载。"

msgid ""
"You can create as many instances of a scene as you'd like. You could have "
"five or ten characters in your game, created from your Character scene."
msgstr ""
"你可以根据需要创建任意数量的场景实例。你的游戏中可以有五个或十个角色，这些角"
"色均由角色场景创建。"

msgid "Creating your first scene"
msgstr "创建第一个场景"

msgid ""
"Let's create our first scene with a single node. To do so, you will need "
"to :ref:`create a new project <doc_creating_and_importing_projects>` first. "
"After opening the project, you should see an empty editor."
msgstr ""
"让我们用单个节点来创建我们的第一个场景吧。为此，你需要先 :ref:`创建一个新项"
"目 <doc_creating_and_importing_projects>` 。在打开项目后，你看到的应该是一个"
"空的编辑器。"

msgid ""
"We're going to add a single :ref:`Label <class_Label>` node to our scene. "
"Its function is to draw text on the screen."
msgstr ""
"我们要往场景中添加单个 :ref:`Label <class_Label>` 节点。它的功能是在屏幕上绘"
"制文字。"

msgid "Select the Label node. You can type its name to filter down the list."
msgstr "选择 Label 节点。你可以输入其名称来筛选列表。"

msgid ""
"A lot happens when you add a scene's first node. The scene changes to the 2D "
"workspace because Label is a 2D node type. The Label appears, selected, in "
"the top-left corner of the viewport. The node appears in the Scene dock on "
"the left, and the node's properties appear in the Inspector dock on the "
"right."
msgstr ""
"添加场景中的第一个节点时会发生很多事。场景会切换到 2D 工作区，因为 Label 是 "
"2D 节点类型。该 Label 会以选中的状态出现在视口的左上角。这个节点也会出现在左"
"侧的“场景”面板中，它的属性会出现在右侧的“检查器”面板里。"

msgid "Changing a node's properties"
msgstr "修改节点的属性"

msgid "You will see the text draw in the viewport as you type."
msgstr "在你打字的同时，你会发现视口中也绘制出了这段文字。"

msgid ""
"You can edit any property listed in the Inspector as we did with the Text. "
"For a complete reference of the Inspector dock, "
"see :ref:`doc_editor_inspector_dock`."
msgstr ""
"你可以修改检查器列出的任何属性，正如我们对文本所作的那样。如果想要查看有关检"

msgid ""
"You can move your Label node in the viewport by selecting the move tool in "
"the toolbar."
msgstr "选择工具栏上的移动工具，就可以在视口中移动你的 Label 节点。"

msgid ""
"With the Label selected, click and drag anywhere in the viewport to move it "
"to the center of the view delimited by the rectangle."

"Godot will use this scene as a starting point."
msgstr ""
"演示程序又会开始运行。此后，每次你运行项目，Godot 都会使用该场景作为起点。"
