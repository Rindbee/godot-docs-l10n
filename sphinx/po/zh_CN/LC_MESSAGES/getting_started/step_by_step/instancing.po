"In the previous part, we saw that a scene is a collection of nodes organized "

"organize your game's different components."
msgstr ""
"上一部分中，我们了解到场景是一系列组织成树状结构的节点，其中只有一个节点是根"

"You can create as many scenes as you'd like and save them as files with the "

"Here's an example of a ball. It's composed of a :ref:`RigidBody2D "

"Programmers tend to spend a lot of time designing abstract architectures and "

msgid ""
"With Godot, it's easy to iterate on your game like this, as all you need to "
"do is create and instantiate more scenes. We designed the editor to be "
