msgid "Godot's design philosophy"
msgstr "Godot 的设计理念"

msgid "Now that you've gotten your feet wet, let's talk about Godot's design."
msgstr "既然你已经小试身手，让我们谈谈 Godot 的设计。"

msgid ""
"**Every game engine is different and fits different needs.** Not only do "
"they offer a range of features, but the design of each engine is unique. "
"This leads to different workflows and different ways to form your games' "
"structures. This all stems from their respective design philosophies."
msgstr ""
"**游戏引擎各不相同，以满足不同的需求。**\\ 它们不仅提供一系列功能，而且每个引"
"擎的设计都是独一无二的。这将导致不同的工作流程和项目组织结构。这一切都源于它"
"们各自的设计理念。"

msgid ""
"This page is here to help you understand how Godot works, starting with some "
"of its core pillars. It is not a list of available features, nor is it an "
"engine comparison. To know if any engine can be a good fit for your project, "
"you need to try it out for yourself and understand its design and "
"limitations."
msgstr ""
"本页是为了帮助你通过 Godot 的一些核心功能来理解它的工作原理。 本页既不是可用"
"特性的列表，也不会对各个引擎做比较。 要知道哪一种引擎更适合你的项目，你需要亲"
"自尝试一下并了解各个引擎的设计和局限性。"

msgid "Object-oriented design and composition"
msgstr "面向对象的设计与组合"

msgid ""
"Godot embraces object-oriented design at its core with its flexible scene "
"system and Node hierarchy. It tries to stay away from strict programming "
"patterns to offer an intuitive way to structure your game."
msgstr ""
"Godot凭借其灵活的场景系统和节点层次结构，将面向对象设计作为其核心。 它试图远"
"离严格的编程模式，以提供直观的方式来构建游戏。"

msgid ""
"For one, Godot lets you **compose or aggregate** scenes. It's like nested "
"prefabs: you can create a BlinkingLight scene and a BrokenLantern scene that "
"uses the BlinkingLight. Then, create a city filled with BrokenLanterns. "
"Change the BlinkingLight's color, save, and all the BrokenLanterns in the "
"city will update instantly."
msgstr ""
"首先，Godot 可以让你把场景\\ **组合或聚合**\\ 起来。这和嵌套的预制件是类似"
"的：你可以创建 BlinkingLight 场景，并使用 BlinkingLight 创建 BrokenLantern 场"
"景。然后，创建一个充满 BrokenLantern 的城市。更改 BlinkingLight 的颜色、保"
"存，城市中的所有 BrokenLantern 都会立即更新。"

msgid "On top of that, you can **inherit** from any scene."
msgstr "更重要的是，你可以从任何场景\\ **继承**\\ 。"

msgid ""
"A Godot scene could be a Weapon, a Character, an Item, a Door, a Level, part "
"of a level… anything you'd like. It works like a class in pure code, except "
"you're free to design it by using the editor, using only the code, or mixing "
"and matching the two."
msgstr ""
"Godot 场景可以是武器、角色、物品、门、关卡、关卡的一部分……任何你能想象的东"
"西。它就像纯代码中的类一样工作，但也可以使用编辑器，纯代码或同时使用两者来设"
"计场景。"

msgid ""
"It's different from prefabs you find in several 3D engines, as you can then "
"inherit from and extend those scenes. You may create a Magician that extends "
"your Character. Modify the Character in the editor and the Magician will "
"update as well. It helps you build your projects so that their structure "
"matches the game's design."
msgstr ""
"和其他几个 3D 引擎的 Prefab（预制体）不同，场景可以通过继承来扩展。你可以创建"
"一个 Magician（魔术师）来扩展你的 Character（角色）。在编辑器中修改 "
"Character 后 Magician 也会更新。这样的设计可以帮你保持项目结构与设计的一致"
"性。"

"Also note that Godot offers many different types of objects called nodes, "
"each with a specific purpose. Nodes are part of a tree and always inherit "
"from their parents up to the Node class. Although the engine does feature "
"some nodes like collision shapes that a parent physics body will use, most "
"nodes work independently from one another."
msgstr ""
"还要注意，Godot 提供了许多不同类型的对象，称为节点，每种节点都有特定的用途。"
"节点是树的一部分，并且始终从其父类继承直到 Node 类。虽然引擎确实具有一些节"
"点，例如碰撞形状将被其父物理体使用，但大多数节点彼此独立工作。"

msgid ""
"In other words, Godot's nodes do not work like components in some other game "
"engines."
msgstr "换句话说，Godot的节点并不像其他一些游戏引擎中的组件那样工作。"

"The goal is to offer a full package to create games and a continuous user "

"`Tiled Map Importer <https://github.com/vnen/godot-tiled-importer>`__."
msgstr ""

"That is also partly why Godot offers its own programming language GDScript "
"along with C#. GDScript is designed for the needs of game developers and "
"game designers, and is tightly integrated in the engine and the editor."
msgstr ""
"这也是为什么 Godot 除了提供 C# 之外还会提供自己的编程语言 GDScript 的部分原"
"因。GDScript 是为满足游戏开发人员和游戏设计师的需求而设计的，并且被紧密集成在"
"引擎和编辑器中。"

msgid ""
"GDScript lets you write code using an indentation-based syntax, yet it "
"detects types and offers a static language's quality of auto-completion. It "
"is also optimized for gameplay code with built-in types like Vectors and "
"Colors."
msgstr ""
"GDScript 让你能够使用基于缩进的语法编写代码，还可以检测类型，提供质量接近静态"

"请注意，使用 GDExtension，你可以编写出使用类似 C、C++、Rust、D、Haxe、Swift "
"这类的编译语言编写的高性能代码，并且无需重新编译引擎。"

msgid ""
"Note that the 3D workspace doesn't feature as many tools as the 2D "
"workspace. You'll need external programs or add-ons to edit terrains, "

"Godot offers a fully open source codebase under the **MIT license**. This "

"contributors."
msgstr ""
"Godot 源代码采用了 **MIT 许可证**\\ 。这意味着它附带的所有技术也必须是自由的"

"Anyone can plug in proprietary tools for the needs of their projects — they "

"of these can come as third-party plugins instead."
msgstr ""
"任何人都可以根据各自需求添加专有软件——当然它们是不会通过引擎一起提供。这可能"
"包括 Google AdMob 或 FMOD。其中任何一个都可以作为第三方插件提供。"

msgid ""
"On the other hand, an open codebase means you can **learn from and extend "
"the engine** to your heart's content. You can also debug games easily, as "
"Godot will print errors with a stack trace, even if they come from the "
"engine itself."
msgstr ""
"另一方面，开放的代码库意味着你可以随心所欲地\\ **学习并扩展引擎**\\ 。你还可"
