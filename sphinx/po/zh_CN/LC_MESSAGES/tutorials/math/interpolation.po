"The basic idea is that you want to transition from A to B. A value ``t``, "
"represents the states in-between."
msgstr "基本思想是从 A 转换到 B。\\ ``t`` 值是介于两者之间的状态。"

msgid ""
"For example, if ``t`` is 0, then the state is A. If ``t`` is 1, then the "
"state is B. Anything in-between is an *interpolation*."
msgstr ""
"举个例子, 如果 ``t`` 是0, 那么他的状态是A. 如果 ``t`` 是1,那么它的 状态是B. "
"任何介于两者之间的状态都是 *插值*."

msgid "And often simplified to:"
