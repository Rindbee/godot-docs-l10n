"The gaming community isn't monolingual or monocultural. It's made up of many "
"different languages and cultures - just like the Godot community! If you "
"want to allow players to experience your game in their language, one of "
"things you'll need to provide is text translations, which Godot supports via "
"internationalized text."

"In regular desktop or mobile applications, internationalized text is usually "
"located in resource files (or .po files for GNU stuff). Games, however, can "
"use several orders of magnitude more text than applications, so they must "
"support efficient methods for dealing with loads of multilingual text."

"在常规的桌面或移动应用程序中，国际化文本通常位于资源文件中（GNU 内容则是 .po "

"There are two approaches to generate multilingual language games and "
"applications. Both are based on a key:value system. The first is to use one "
"of the languages as the key (usually English), the second is to use a "
"specific identifier. The first approach is probably easier for development "
"if a game is released first in English, later in other languages, but a "
"complete nightmare if working with many languages at the same time."

"中一种语言作为“键”（通常是英语），第二种是使用特定的标识符。如果首先用英语发"
"布游戏，后来以其他语言发布游戏，则第一种方法可能更易于开发；但是如果同时使用"
"多种语言，则完全是一场噩梦。"

msgid ""
"In general, games use the second approach and a unique ID is used for each "
"string. This allows you to revise the text while it is being translated to "
"other languages. The unique ID can be a number, a string, or a string with a "
"number (it's just a unique string anyway)."

"一般来说, 游戏使用第二种方法, 并为每个字符串使用唯一的ID. 这允许你在翻译为其"
