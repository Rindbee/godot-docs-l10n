msgid ""
"To complete the cycle and swap out the new scene with the old one, you have "
"a choice to make. Many strategies exist for removing a scene from view of "
"the :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>`. The tradeoffs involve balancing "
"operation speed and memory consumption, as well as balancing data access and "
"integrity."
msgstr ""
"要完成循环并将旧场景替换为新场景, 开发人员可以选择制作. 从视"
"图 :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` 中删除场景有很多策略. 权衡涉及平衡操作速"
"度和内存消耗以及平衡数据访问和完整性."

msgid "Unloads memory."
msgstr "卸载内存."

msgid "Pro: RAM is no longer dragging the dead weight."
msgstr "好处: RAM不再拖累自重."

msgid ""
"Con: Returning to that scene is now more expensive since it must be loaded "
"back into memory again (takes time AND memory). Not a problem if returning "
"soon is unnecessary."
msgstr ""
"坏处: 回到那个场景现在更加昂贵, 因为它必须再次加载回内存(需要时间和内存). 如"
"果不久就回来是不必要的."

msgid ""
"Con: No longer have access to that scene's data. Not a problem if using that "
"data soon is unnecessary."
msgstr "坏处: 无法再访问该场景的数据. 如果不久就使用这些数据就不成问题了."

msgid ""
"Note: It can be useful to preserve the data in a soon-to-be-deleted scene by "
"re-attaching one or more of its nodes to a different scene, or even directly "
"to the :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>`."
msgstr ""
"注意: 通过将一个或多个节点重新附加到不同的场景, 甚至直接将其重新附加"
"到 :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>`, 可以将数据保存在即将删除的场景中."

msgid "Processing stops."
msgstr "处理停止."

msgid ""
"Con: Those nodes' processing and input handling no longer operate. Not a "
"problem if using the updated data is unnecessary."
msgstr ""
"坏处: 这些节点的处理和输入处理不再运行. 如果不需要使用更新的数据, 则不成问题."

msgid "Memory still exists."
msgstr "记忆仍然存在."

msgid "Pro: There's no need to move any more nodes around to save data."
msgstr "好处: 无需再移动任何节点来保存数据."

msgid "Processing continues."
msgstr "处理继续."

msgid ""
"Pro: Nodes are still members of groups (since groups belong to "
"the :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>`)."
msgstr ""
"Pro: 节点仍然是组的成员(因为组属于 :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>`)."

msgid ""
"Con: Unlike with hiding it from view only, the data contained within the "
"scene will become stale if it relies on delta time, input, groups, or other "
"data that is derived from :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` access."
msgstr ""
"坏处：与仅从视图中隐藏它不同，如果场景中包含的数据依赖于时间增量、输入、分组"
"或其他通过访问 :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` 才能得到的数据，则它将变为"
"陈旧。"
