"Godot comes with a powerful debugger and profilers to track down bugs, "
"inspect your game at runtime, monitor essential metrics, and measure "
"performances. It also offers options to visualize collision boxes and "
"navigation polygons in the running game."
msgstr ""
"Godot自带强大的调试器和剖析器, 可以追踪bug, 在运行时检查你的游戏, 监控重要指"
"标, 并测量性能. 它还提供了在运行游戏中可视化碰撞框和导航多边形的选项."

"Finally, you have options to debug the game running on a remote device and "
"to reload changes to your scenes or your code while the game is running."
msgstr ""
"最后, 你可以选择调试在远程设备上运行的游戏, 并在游戏运行时重新加载对你的场景"

msgstr "使用远程调试部署"

msgid ""
"When this option is enabled, using one-click deploy will make the executable "
"attempt to connect to this computer's IP so the running project can be "
"debugged. This option is intended to be used for remote debugging (typically "

"then provides files from the project over the network."
msgstr ""
"当\\ **使用网络文件系统进行小型部署**\\ 开启时，部署游戏不是导出整个游戏，而"

"editor (on the left of the line numbers). When hovering this gutter, you "
"will see a transparent red dot appearing, which turns into an opaque red dot "
"after the breakpoint is placed by clicking. Click the red dot again to "
