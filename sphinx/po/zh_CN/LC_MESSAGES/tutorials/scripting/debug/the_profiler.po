"If your function is complex, it could be challenging to figure out which "
"part needs optimization. Is it your math or the way you access other pieces "
"of data to do the math with? Is it the `for` loop? The `if` statements?"

"You can narrow down the measurement by manually counting ticks as the code "
"runs with some temporary functions. The two functions are part of the `Time` "
"class object. They are `get_ticks_msec` and `get_ticks_usec`. The first "
"measures in milliseconds (1,000 per second), and the second measures in "
"microseconds (1,000,000 per second)."
