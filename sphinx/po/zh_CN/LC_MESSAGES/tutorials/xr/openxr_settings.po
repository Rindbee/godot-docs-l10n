msgid "OpenXR Settings"
msgstr "OpenXR 设置"

msgid ""
"OpenXR has its own set of settings that are applied when OpenXR starts. "
"While it is possible for OpenXR extensions implemented through Godot plugins "
"to add additional settings, we will only discuss the settings in the core of "
"Godot here."
msgstr ""
"OpenXR 有一套自己的设置，这些设置会在 OpenXR 启动时应用。尽管能通过插件实现"
"的 OpenXR 扩展以添加额外设置，但在这里我们只讨论 Godot 核心中的设置。"

msgid "Enabled"
msgstr "Enabled"

msgid ""
"This setting enables the OpenXR module when Godot starts. This is required "
"when the Vulkan backend is used. For other backends you can enable OpenXR at "
"any time by calling ``initialize`` on the :ref:`OpenXRInterface "
"<class_openxrinterface>`."
msgstr ""
"此设置决定了在 Godot 启动时是否启用 OpenXR。当使用 Vulkan 后端时，该选项必须"
"打开。对于其他后端，可随时通过调用 :ref:`OpenXRInterface "
"<class_openxrinterface>` 类的 ``initialize`` 来启用 OpenXR。"

msgid "This also needs to be enabled to get access to the action map editor."
msgstr "如果要访问动作映射编辑器，该选项也需启用。"

msgid ""
"You can use the ``--xr-mode on`` command line switch to force this to on."
msgstr "你可以使用 ``--xr-mode on`` 命令行指令以强制启用该模式。"

msgid "Default Action Map"
msgstr "默认动作映射"

msgid ""
"This specifies the path of the action map file that OpenXR will load and "
"communicate to the XR Runtime."
msgstr "该选项指定了 OpenXR 将加载并与 XR 运行时通信的操作映射文件的路径。"

msgid "Form Factor"
msgstr "构成因素"

msgid "This specifies whether your game is designed for:"
msgstr "该选项指定了你的游戏是为以下哪种设备设计的："

msgid ""
"``Head Mounted`` devices such as a Meta Quest, Valve Index, or Magic Leap,"
msgstr ""
"``Head Mounted`` 头戴式设备，如 Meta Quest、Valve Index 或 Magic Leap，"

msgid "``Handheld`` devices such as phones."
msgstr "``Handheld`` 手持设备，例如手机。"

msgid ""
"If the device on which you run your game does not match the selection here, "
"OpenXR will fail to initialise."
msgstr "如果运行游戏的设备与此处不匹配，OpenXR 将无法初始化。"

msgid "View Configuration"
msgstr "视图配置"

msgid "This specifies the view configuration your game is designed for:"
msgstr "该选项指定了游戏是为哪种视图配置而设计的："

msgid ""
"OpenXR has additional view configurations for very specific devices that "
"Godot doesn't support yet. For instance, Varjo headsets have a quad view "
"configuration that outputs two sets of stereo images. These may be supported "
"in the near future."
msgstr ""
"Godot 暂不支持 OpenXR 中针对特定设备的额外视图配置。例如，Varjo 头显有一个四"
"视图配置，可以输出两组立体图像。这些特例可能会在不久的将来得到支持。"

msgid "Reference Space"
msgstr "参照空间"

msgid ""
"Within XR all elements like the player's head and hands are tracked within a "
"tracking volume. At the base of this tracking volume is our origin point, "
"which maps our virtual space to the real space. There are however different "
"scenarios that place this point in different locations, depending on the XR "
"system used. In OpenXR these scenarios are well defined and selected by "
"setting a reference space."
msgstr ""
"在 XR 中，玩家的头部和手部等所有元素的追踪都在一个追踪体积内进行。这个追踪体"
"积的基点是将虚拟空间映射到现实空间的原点。根据使用的 XR 系统的不同，该点会被"
"放置在不同的位置。在 OpenXR 中，这些场景被明确定义，并通过设置参考空间来选"
"择。"

msgid "Local"
msgstr "Local（本地）"

msgid ""
"The local reference space places our origin point at the player's head by "
"default. Some XR runtimes will do this each time your game starts, others "
"will make the position persist over sessions."
msgstr ""
"本地参照空间默认将原点放置在玩家的头部。一些 XR 运行时会在游戏启动时重设该位"
"置，而其他则会让该位置在多个会话中保持不变。"

msgid ""
"This reference space however does not prevent the user from walking away so "
"you will need to detect if the user does so if you wish to prevent the user "
"from leaving the vehicle they are controlling, which could potentially be "
"game breaking."
msgstr ""
"然而，这种参照空间并不会阻止用户走开，因此如果你希望阻止用户离开他们正在控制"
"的部件（这可能会破坏游戏），则需要检测用户是否离开。"

msgid ""
"This reference space is the best option for games like flight simulators or "
"racing simulators where we want to place the :ref:`XROrigin3D "
"<class_xrorigin3d>` node where the player's head should be."
msgstr ""
"本地参照空间是飞行模拟器或赛车模拟器的最佳选择，这类游戏通常希望将 :ref:"

"which is different per XR runtime, the XR runtime will move the :ref:"
"`XRCamera3D <class_xrcamera3d>` to the :ref:`XROrigin3D <class_xrorigin3d>` "

msgstr ""

"ref:`XRCamera3D <class_xrcamera3d>` 移动到 :ref:`XROrigin3D "

msgid "Stage"
msgstr "Stage（暂存区）"

msgid ""
"The stage reference space is our default reference space and places our "
"origin point at the center of our play space. For XR runtimes that allow you "
"to draw out a guardian boundary this location and its orientation is often "
"set by the user. Other XR runtimes may decide on the placement of this point "
"by other means. It is however a stationary point in the real world."
msgstr ""
"Stage 参照空间是默认参照空间设置，此选项将原点放置在游戏空间的中心。对于允许"
"用户绘制防护边界的 XR 运行时来说，这个位置及其方向通常由用户设置，而其他 XR "
"运行时可能会通过其他方式来决定该点位置。不过原点在现实世界中还是静态不动的。"

msgid ""
"This reference space is the best option for room scale games where the user "

"need to switch between game modes. See :ref:`Room Scale <doc_xr_room_scale>` "
"for more information."
msgstr ""
"该参照空间最适合在游戏涉及房间尺度，并且用户预计会在较大空间中活动时使用。同"

"度 <doc_xr_room_scale>`\\ 。"

msgid ""
"When the user enacts the recenter option on their headset, the method of "
"which is different per XR runtime, the XR runtime will not change the origin "
"point. The :ref:`OpenXRInterface <class_openxrinterface>` will emit the "
"``pose_recentered`` signal and it is up to the game to react appropriately. "
"Not doing so will prevent your game from being accepted on various stores."
msgstr ""
"当用户在其头戴设备上执行重置时（重置在不同 XR 运行时中有所不同）， XR 运行时"
"不会更改原点。\\ :ref:`OpenXRInterface <class_openxrinterface>` 将发出 "
"``pose_recentered`` 信号，游戏需要根据此信号做出适当反应。未正确处理可能导致"

"``center_on_hmd`` 函数来实现："

msgid ""
"Calling ``XRServer.center_on_hmd(XRServer.RESET_BUT_KEEP_TILT, true)`` will "

msgid ""
"It is thus not guaranteed the player will be standing on the origin point, "
"the only guarantee is that they were standing there when the user last "
"recentered. The player is thus also free to walk away."
msgstr ""
"因此，不能保证玩家会站在原点上，唯一的保证是当用户最后一次回到中心时，他们站"
"在那里。玩家因此也可以自由离开。"

msgid ""
"This reference space is the best option of games where the user is expected "
"to stand in the same location or for AR type games where the user's "
"interface elements are bound to the origin node and are quickly placed at "
"the player's location on recenter."
msgstr ""

msgid "Foveation Dynamic"
msgstr "动态注视点"

msgid ""
"When enabled the foveation level will be adjusted automatically depending on "
"current GPU load. It will be adjusted between low and the select foveation "
"level in the previous setting. It is therefore best to combine this setting "
"with foveation level set to high."
msgstr ""
"启用后，视野水平将根据当前的GPU负载自动调整。它将在低和先前设置中选择的视野水"
"平之间调整。因此，最好将此设置与设置为高的视野等级相结合。"

msgid "Submit Depth Buffer"
msgstr "提交深度缓冲区"

msgid ""
"If enabled an OpenXR supplied depth buffer will be used while rendering "
"which is submitted alongside the rendered image. The XR runtime can use this "
