"This page focuses specifically on the feature set exposed through OpenXR. "
"Parts of the functionality presented here also applies to WebXR and can by "
"provided by other XR interfaces."

"When discussing hand tracking it is important to know that there are "
"differences of opinion as to where lines are drawn. The practical result of "
"this is that there are differences in implementation between the different "
"OpenXR runtimes. You may find yourself in a place where chosen hardware "
"doesn't support a piece of the puzzle or does things differently enough from "
"the other platforms that you need to do extra work."
msgstr ""
"在讨论手跟踪前应当先意识到，各个不同的系统对各个区域的理解不同。因此，不同的 "
"OpenXR 运行时实现的表现也会不同。在开发过程中，你可能遇到某硬件不支持某一操作"
"的问题，或者出现与其他平台表现的差别大到需要额外处理的情况。"

msgid ""
"That said, recent improvements to the OpenXR specification are closing these "
"gaps and as platforms implement these improvements we are getting closer to "
"a future where we have either full portability between platforms or at least "
"a clear way to detect the capabilities of a platform."
msgstr ""
"尽管如此，近期对 OpenXR 规范的改进缩小了这种差距，而随着各个平台开始实现新版"
"规范，我们也在逐步迈向一个各个平台之间可以完美移植的美好未来，或者至少能拥有"
"一个可以检测平台功能的明确方法。"

"When we look at the early days of VR the focus of the major platforms was on "
"tracked controller based input. Here we are tracking a physical device that "
"also has buttons for further input. From the tracking data we can infer the "
"location of the player's hands but no further information is known, "
"traditionally it was left up to the game to implement a mechanism to display "
"the player's hand and animate the fingers based on further input from the "
"controller, be it due to buttons being pressed or through proximity sensors. "
"Often fingers are also placed based on context, what the user is holding, "
"and what action a user is performing."
msgstr ""
"早期的大型 VR 平台主要采用的是基于跟踪手柄的输入。这套系统追踪一个物理设备，"
"该设备上还装有一系列按键，用于进一步的输入。从跟踪数据中可以推断出玩家手部位"
"置，但无法进一步获取更多信息。通常情况下，由游戏负责实现一套利用进一步输入来"
"显示玩家的手部并创建手指动画的机制，其中的输入可能来自于按键或接近传感器。大"
"部分时候手指的位置还会参考游戏上下文进行判断，例如用户手持的物品，或者正在进"
"行的动作。"

msgid ""
"More recently optical hand tracking has become a popular solution, where "
"cameras track the user's hands and full tracking data for the hand and "
"finger positions becomes available. Many vendors saw this as completely "
"separate from controller tracking and introduced independent APIs to access "
"hand and finger positions and orientation data. When handling input, it was "
"up to the game developer to implement a gesture detection mechanism."
msgstr ""
"近来，光学手部跟踪逐渐开始流行，这套系统使用摄像头来追踪用户手部，可以生成完"
"整的手部和手指位置数据。大部分供应商将其视为完全不同于手柄跟踪的一套体系，并"
"发布了独立的 API 来访问手部和手指的位置与旋转数据。在处理输入时，由游戏开发人"
"员负责实现手势检测系统。"

msgid ""
"This split also exists in OpenXR, where controller tracking is handled "
"primarily by the action map system, while optical hand tracking is primarily "
"handled by the hand tracking API extension."
msgstr ""
"这种两边分割的情况同样存在于 OpenXR 中，其中手柄跟踪主要由动作映射系统处理，"
"而光学手部跟踪则主要由手部跟踪 API 扩展处理。"

msgid ""
"However, the world is not that black and white and we're seeing a number of "
"scenarios where we cross the line:"
msgstr "然而，这世界并非非黑即白，有这么几种情况难以简单地归类："

"Devices that fit in both categories, such as tracked gloves and controllers "
"such as the Index controller that also perform finger tracking."
msgstr ""
"同时符合两种类别的设备，例如带跟踪的手套或手柄，例如同时拥有手指追踪功能的 "
"Index controller。"

"XR Runtimes that implement inferred hand tracking from controller data as a "

"Actual placement of the hands may be loosely bound to the tracking in "

"手部的实际放置位置可能与追踪结果存在松散绑定关系。这种情况常见于角色创建界"
