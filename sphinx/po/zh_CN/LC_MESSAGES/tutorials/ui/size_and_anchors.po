"If a game was always going to be run on the same device and at the same "
"resolution, positioning controls would be a simple matter of setting the "
"position and size of each one of them. Unfortunately, that is rarely the "
"case."
msgstr ""
"如果一个游戏总是用同一分辨率在同样的设备上运行, 摆放控件将是一个简单的事, 只"
"要逐个设置它们的位置属性和大小属性即可. 不幸的是, 能像这样处理的情况很少."

msgid ""
"While some configurations may be more common than others, devices like "
"phones, tablets and portable gaming consoles can vary greatly. Therefore, we "
"often have to account for different aspect ratios, resolutions and user "
"scaling."
msgstr ""
"虽然某些配置可能比其他配置更常见，但手机、平板电脑和便携式游戏机等设备可能会"
"有很大差异。因此，我们通常需要考虑不同的宽高比、分辨率和用户缩放比例。"

msgid ""
"There are several ways to account for this, but for now, let's just imagine "
"that the screen resolution has changed and the controls need to be re-"
"positioned. Some will need to follow the bottom of the screen, others the "
"top of the screen, or maybe the right or left margins."
msgstr ""
"有几种方法来处理这个问题, 但现在, 让我们想象一下, 屏幕分辨率已经改变, 控件需"
"要重新定位. 有的需要跟随屏幕的底部, 有的需要跟随屏幕的顶部, 也有的需要跟随左"
"右边距."

msgid ""
"This is done by editing the *anchor offsets* of controls, which behave "
"similar to a margin. To access these settings, you will first need to select "
"the *Custom* anchor preset."
msgstr ""
"这是通过编辑控件的 *锚点偏移量* 来实现的，其行为类似于边距。要访问这些设置，"
"你需要先选择 *自定义* 锚点预设。"

msgid ""
"Each control has four anchor offsets: left, right, bottom, and top, which "
"correspond to the respective edges of the control. By default, all of them "
"represent a distance in pixels relative to the top-left corner of the parent "
"control or (in case there is no parent control) the viewport."
msgstr ""
"每个控件都有四个边距：左、右、底、顶，分别与控件的边缘相对应。默认情况下，它"
"们都表示相对于父控件的左上角或（在没有父控件的情况下）视口的像素距离。"

msgid ""
"So to make the control wider you can make the right offset larger and/or "
"make the left offset smaller. This lets you set the exact placement and "
"shape of the control."
msgstr ""
"因此，要使控件变宽，可以增大右边距和/或减小左边距。这使你可以设置控件的精确位"
"置和形状。"

msgid ""
"Note that when you wish the edge of a control to be above or left of the "
"anchor point, you must change the offset value to be negative."
msgstr ""
"请注意，当你希望控件的边缘位于锚点的上方或左侧时，必须将边距值更改为负数。"

msgid ""
"Adjusting the two horizontal or the two vertical anchors to different values "
"will make the control change size when the parent control does. Here, the "
"control is set to anchor its bottom-right corner to the parent's bottom-"
"right, while the top-left control offsets are still anchored to the top-left "
"of the parent, so when re-sizing the parent, the control will always cover "
"it, leaving a 20 pixel offset:"
msgstr ""
"调整两个水平或两个垂直锚点到不同的值，将使控件在父控件改变大小时也随之改变。"
"在这里，控件的右下角锚定到父控件的右下角，而左上角的控件边距仍然锚定到父控件"
"的左上角，因此在调整父控件大小时，控件将始终覆盖父控件，并留有 20 像素的边"
"距："

msgid "Centering a control"
msgstr "使控件居中"

msgid ""
"To center a control in its parent, set its anchors to ``0.5`` and each "
"offset to half of its relevant dimension. For example, the code below shows "
"how a TextureRect can be centered in its parent:"
msgstr ""
"要将控件在其父控件内居中，请将锚点都设置为 ``0.5``\\ ， 每侧边距为其相关尺寸"
"的一半。例如， 下面的代码显示了如何将 TextureRect 在它的父节点内居中："

msgid ""
"Setting each anchor to ``0.5`` moves the reference point for the offsets to "
"the center of its parent. From there, we set negative offsets so that the "
"control gets its natural size."
msgstr ""
"将每个锚定值设置为0.5, 将边缘的参考点移动到父锚点的中心. 在此基础上, 我们设置"
"了负边距, 以便控件获得其自然大小."

msgid "Anchor Presets"
msgstr "布局预设"

msgid ""
"Instead of manually adjusting the offset and anchor values, you can use the "
"toolbar's Anchor menu, above the viewport. Besides centering, it gives you "
"many options to align and resize control nodes."
msgstr ""
"除了手动调整边距和锚点的值之外，你还可以使用视口上方工具栏中的“布局”菜单。其"
"中有居中等诸多选项，可以用来对齐并调整节点的大小。"
