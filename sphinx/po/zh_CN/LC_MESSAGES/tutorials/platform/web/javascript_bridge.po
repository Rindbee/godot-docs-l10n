msgid "The JavaScriptBridge Singleton"

"In web builds, the :ref:`JavaScriptBridge <class_JavaScriptBridge>` "
"singleton allows interaction with JavaScript and web browsers, and can be "

msgid "Interacting with JavaScript"
msgstr "与光交互"

msgid ""
"Sometimes, when exporting Godot for the Web, it might be necessary to "
"interface with external JavaScript code like third-party SDKs, libraries, or "
"simply to access browser features that are not directly exposed by Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``JavaScriptBridge`` singleton provides methods to wrap a native "
"JavaScript object into a Godot :ref:`JavaScriptObject "
"<class_JavaScriptObject>` that tries to feel natural in the context of Godot "
"scripting (e.g. GDScript and C#)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ref:`JavaScriptBridge.get_interface() "
"<class_JavaScriptBridge_method_get_interface>` method retrieves an object in "
"the global scope."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The :ref:`JavaScriptBridge.create_object() "
"<class_JavaScriptBridge_method_create_object>` creates a new object via the "
"JavaScript ``new`` constructor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As you can see, by wrapping JavaScript objects into ``JavaScriptObject`` you "
"can interact with them like they were native Godot objects, calling their "
"methods, and retrieving (or even setting) their properties."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Base types (int, floats, strings, booleans) are automatically converted "
"(floats might lose precision when converted from Godot to JavaScript). "
"Anything else (i.e. objects, arrays, functions) are seen as "
"``JavaScriptObjects`` themselves."

msgid "Callbacks"
msgstr "字体回退"

msgid ""
"Calling JavaScript code from Godot is nice, but sometimes you need to call a "
"Godot function from JavaScript instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This case is a bit more complicated. JavaScript relies on garbage "
"collection, while Godot uses reference counting for memory management. This "
"means you have to explicitly create callbacks (which are returned as "
"``JavaScriptObjects`` themselves) and you have to keep their reference."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Arguments passed by JavaScript to the callback will be passed as a single "
"Godot ``Array``."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Here is another example that asks the user for the `Notification permission "
"<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API>`__ and "
"waits asynchronously to deliver a notification if the permission is granted:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Can I use my favorite library?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You most likely can. First, you have to include your library in the page. "
"You can simply customize the :ref:`Head Include "
"<doc_javascript_export_options>` during export (see below), or even :ref:"
"`write your own template <doc_customizing_html5_shell>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the example below, we customize the ``Head Include`` to add an external "
"library (`axios <https://axios-http.com/>`__) from a content delivery "
"network, and a second ``<script>`` tag to define our own custom function:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We can then access both the library and the function from Godot, like we did "
"in previous examples:"

msgid ""
"The ``eval`` method works similarly to the JavaScript function of the same "
"name. It takes a string as an argument and executes it as JavaScript code. "
"This allows interacting with the browser in ways not possible with script "
"languages integrated into Godot."
msgstr ""
"在Web构建中, 实现了 ``JavaScript`` 单例. 它提供一个名为 ``eval`` 的方法, 其工"
"作方式与同名的JavaScript函数类似. 它将字符串作为参数, 并将其作为JavaScript代"
"码执行. 这允许以与集成到Godot中的脚本语言不可能的方式与浏览器交互."

msgid ""
"The value of the last JavaScript statement is converted to a GDScript value "
"and returned by ``eval()`` under certain circumstances:"
msgstr ""
"最后一个JavaScript语句的值转换为GDScript值，并在某些情况下由 ``eval()`` 返回:"

msgid "JavaScript ``number`` is returned as :ref:`class_float`"
msgstr "JavaScript ``number`` 会以 :ref:`class_float` 返回"

msgid "JavaScript ``boolean`` is returned as :ref:`class_bool`"
msgstr "JavaScript ``boolean`` 会以 :ref:`class_bool` 返回"

msgid "JavaScript ``string`` is returned as :ref:`class_String`"
msgstr "JavaScript ``string`` 会以 :ref:`class_String` 返回"

"JavaScript ``ArrayBuffer``, ``TypedArray``, and ``DataView`` are returned "
"as :ref:`PackedByteArray<class_PackedByteArray>`"
msgstr ""
"JavaScript ``RellBuffer`` ， ``TypedArray`` 和 ``DataView`` 会以 :ref:"
"`class_PoolByteArray` 返回"

msgid "Any other JavaScript value is returned as ``null``."
msgstr "任何其他JavaScript值都返回为 ``null`` ."

msgid ""
"HTML5 export templates may be :ref:`built <doc_compiling_for_web>` without "
"support for the singleton to improve security. With such templates, and on "
"platforms other than HTML5, calling ``JavaScriptBridge.eval`` will also "
"return ``null``. The availability of the singleton can be checked with the "
"``web`` :ref:`feature tag <doc_feature_tags>`:"
msgstr ""
"HTML5 导出模板可能为了提高安全性而在 :ref:`构建 <doc_compiling_for_web>` 时关"
"闭单例支持。使用这样的模板或者在 HTML5 以外的平台上调用 ``JavaScript.eval`` "
"也会返回 ``null``\\ 。可以通过 ``JavaScript`` :ref:`feature 标签 "
"<doc_feature_tags>` 来检查单例的可用性： ::"

msgid ""
"GDScript's multi-line strings, surrounded by 3 quotes ``\"\"\"`` as in "
"``my_func3()`` above, are useful to keep JavaScript code readable."
msgstr ""
"GDScript中的多行字符串由3双引号 ``\"\"\"`` 包围, 如同上文中的 ``my_func3()`` "
"那样, 有助于保证JavaScript代码的可读性."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The ``eval`` method also accepts a second, optional Boolean argument, which "
"specifies whether to execute the code in the global execution context, "
"defaulting to ``false`` to prevent polluting the global namespace:"
msgstr ""
"``eval`` 方法也接受第二个可选的布尔参数，它指定是否在全局执行上下文中执行代"
"码，默认为 ``false`` 以防止污染全局命名空间： ::"

msgid "Downloading files"
msgstr "下载"

msgid ""
"Downloading files (e.g. a save game) from the Godot Web export to the user's "
"computer can be done by directly interacting with JavaScript, but given it "
"is a very common use case, Godot exposes this functionality to scripting via "
"a dedicated :ref:`JavaScriptBridge.download_buffer() "
"<class_JavaScriptBridge_method_download_buffer>` function which lets you "
"download any generated buffer."
