"Godot provides several types of trails you can add to a particle system. "
"Before you can work with trails, you need to set up a couple of parameters "
"first. Create a new particle system and assign a process material :ref:`as "
"described before <doc_creating_3d_particle_system>`. In the ``Trails`` group "
"of the particle system, check the box next to ``Enabled`` and increase the "
"emission duration by setting ``Lifetime`` to something like ``0.8``. On the "
"process material, set ``Direction`` to ``(X=0,Y=1.0,Z=0)`` and ``Initial "
"Velocity`` to ``10.0`` for both ``Min`` and ``Max``."

"You have two options for the ribbon mesh ``Shape`` parameter. ``Cross`` "
