"There are two things you have to do before turbulence has any effect on a "
"particle system. First you must add movement to the particle system. "
"Turbulence modifies a particle's movement direction and speed, but it "
"doesn't create any. It is enough to give the particle system some gravity, "
"but you can just as well create a number of attractors if you want the "
"particles to follow a more complex movement path. Second, you need to :ref:"

"Turbulence makes use of 3D noise, which has a high performance cost on the "

msgid "Noise properties"

msgid ""
"The basis for particle turbulence is a noise pattern. There are several "
"properties that allow you to manipulate different attributes of this pattern."
msgstr "粒子湍流的基础是噪点模式。有几个属性允许你操作此模式的不同特质。"

msgid ""
"The ``Noise Strength`` property controls the pattern's contrast, which "
"affects the overall turbulence sharpness. A lower value creates a softer "
"pattern where individual movement paths are not as sharply separated from "
"another. Set this to a higher number to make the pattern more distinct."
msgstr ""
"``Noise Strength`` 属性控制图案的对比度，这会影响整体湍流清晰度。较低的值会创"
"建一个更柔和的模式，其中单个粒子移动路径不会与另一个移动路径明显分开。将此值"
"设置为更高的数字以使这个模式下更加清晰。"

msgid "Turbulence noise strength"
msgstr "湍流噪点强度"

"At a value of 1 (left), the noise strength produces softer turbulence "
"patterns than at 20 (right)"
msgstr "当值为 1（左）时，噪点强度产生的湍流模式比 20（右）时更柔和"

msgid ""
"The ``Noise Scale`` property controls the pattern's frequency. It basically "
"changes the noise texture's UV scale where a smaller value produces finer "
"detail, but repeating patterns become noticeable faster. A larger value "
"results in a weaker turbulence pattern overall, but the particle system can "
"cover a larger area before repetition starts to become an issue."
msgstr ""
"``Noise Scale`` 属性控制模式的频率。它基本上改变了噪点纹理的UV标度，其中较小"
"的值会产生更精细的细节，但重复的图案会更快地变得明显。较大的值会导致整体湍流"
"模式较弱，但在重复开始成为问题之前，粒子系统可以覆盖更大的区域。"

"The ``Noise Speed`` property takes a vector and controls the noise panning "
"speed and direction. This allows you to move the noise pattern over time, "
"which adds another layer of movement variation to the particle system."
msgstr ""
"``Noise Speed`` 属性采用向量并控制噪点平移速度和方向。这允许你随时间移动噪点"
"图案，从而为粒子系统添加另一层移动变化。"

msgid ""
"Don't mix up particle movement speed and noise panning speed! They are two "
"different things. Particle movement is determined by a number of properties, "
"including the turbulence noise. The ``Noise Speed`` property moves the "
"pattern itself, which in turn changes where the noise affects the particles."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""
"当值为 ``(X=0,Y=0,Z=0)`` 时，噪点图案根本不会移动。对粒子运动的影响在任何给定"

"The ``Noise Speed Random`` property adds some randomness to the noise "
"panning speed. This helps with breaking up visible patterns, especially at "

msgstr ""
"``Noise Speed Random`` 属性为噪点平移速度增加了一些随机性。这有助于打破可预见"
"的模式，尤其是在较高的平移速度下，当重复变得明显时。"

msgid "Influence properties"
msgstr "影响属性"

msgid ""
"The influence properties determine how much each particle is affected by "
"turbulence. Use ``Influence Min`` to set a minimum value and ``Influence "
"Max`` to set a maximum value. When a particle spawns, the influence is "
"randomly chosen from within this range. You can also set up a curve with the "
"``Influence Over Life`` property that modifies that value over each "
"particle's lifetime. These three properties together control the strength of "
"the turbulence's effect on the particle system :ref:`as described before "
"<doc_process_material_properties>`."
msgstr ""
"影响属性决定了每个粒子受湍流影响的程度。使用 ``Influence Min`` 设置最小值，使"

"照该曲线修改影响值。这三个属性共同控制着湍流对粒子系统的影响强度 :ref:`as "
"described before <doc_process_material_properties>` 。"

msgid ""
"Since these properties affect the overall influence of the turbulence over a "
"particle system, both movement direction and speed change as you set "
"different values. A stronger influence causes a particle to move faster and "
"all particles to follow along narrower paths as a result of that."
msgstr ""
"由于这些属性会影响湍流对粒子系统的整体影响，因此当你设置不同的值时，移动方向"
