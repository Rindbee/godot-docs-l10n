"Particle attractors are nodes that apply a force to all particles within "
"their reach. They pull particles closer or push them away based on the "
"direction of that force. There are three types of attractors: :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesAttractorBox3D`, :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesAttractorSphere3D`, and :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D`. You can instantiate them at "
"runtime and change their properties from gameplay code; you can even animate "
"and combine them for complex attraction effects."

"The first thing you have to do if you want to use attractors is enable the "

"``Attenuation`` controls the strength falloff within the attractor's "

"weakest at the border of this boundary and strongest at its center. "
"Particles outside of the boundary are not affected by the attractor at all. "
"The attenuation curve controls how the strength weakens over that distance. "
"A straight line means that the strength is proportional to the distance: if "
"a particle is halfway between the boundary and the center, the attractor "
"strength will be half of what it is at the center. Different curve shapes "

"The ``Directionality`` property changes the direction towards which "

"are instead pulled along the ``+Z``-axis."
msgstr ""
"``Directionality`` 属性可改变粒子被拉动的方向。值为 ``0.0`` 时，没有方向性，"
