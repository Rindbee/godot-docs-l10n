"Particle attractors are nodes that apply a force to all particles within "
"their reach. They pull particles closer or push them away based on the "
"direction of that force. There are three types of attractors: :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesAttractorBox3D`, :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesAttractorSphere3D`, and :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D`. You can instantiate them at "
"runtime and change their properties from gameplay code; you can even animate "
"and combine them for complex attraction effects."

"``Attenuation`` controls the strength falloff within the attractor's "

"weakest at the border of this boundary and strongest at its center. "
"Particles outside of the boundary are not affected by the attractor at all. "
"The attenuation curve controls how the strength weakens over that distance. "
"A straight line means that the strength is proportional to the distance: if "

"strength will be half of what it is at the center. Different curve shapes "
