"The checkbox next to the ``Emitting`` property activates and deactivates the "
"particle system. Particles will only be processed and rendered if the box is "
"checked. You can set this property at runtime if you want to activate or "
"deactivate particle systems dynamically."
msgstr ""
"``Emitting`` 属性旁边的复选框用于激活和停用粒子系统。只有选中该复选框被时，才"
"会处理和渲染粒子。如果需要动态激活或停用粒子系统，可以在运行时设置此属性。"

msgid ""
"The ``Amount`` property controls the maximum number of particles visible at "
"any given time. Increase the value to spawn more particles at the cost of "
"performance."
msgstr ""
"``Amount`` 属性控制着在任何时间下可见粒子的最大数量。增加这个值将会在消耗性能"
"的同时生成更多的粒子。"

msgid ""
"The ``Amount Ratio`` property is the ratio of particles compared to the "
"amount that will be emitted. If it's less than ``1.0``, the amount of "
"particles emitted through the lifetime will be the ``Amount`` * ``Amount "
"Ratio``. Changing this value while emitted doesn't affect already created "
"particles and doesn't cause the particle system to restart. It's useful for "
"making effects where the number of emitted particles varies over time."
msgstr ""
"``Amount Ratio`` 属性是粒子与要射出的粒子数量的比例。如果它小于 ``1.0``\\ ，"
"则生命周期内发射的粒子数量将为 ``Ammount`` * ``Amount Ratio``\\ 。发射后更改"
"此数值不会影响已创建的粒子，也不会导致粒子系统重新启动。对于制作发射粒子的数"
"量随时间变化的效果来说这个属性很有用。"

msgid ""
"You can set another particle node as a ``Sub Emitter``, which will be "
"spawned as a child of each particle. See the :ref:`Sub-emitters "
"<doc_3d_particles_subemitters>` section in this manual for a detailed "
"explanation of how to add a sub-emitter to a particle system."
msgstr ""
"可以将另一个粒子节点设置为 ``子发射器``\\ ，它将作为每个粒子的子节点生成。有"

msgid "Time properties"
msgstr "时间属性"

msgid ""
"The ``Lifetime`` property controls how long each particle exists before it "
"disappears again. It is measured in seconds. A lot of particle properties "
"can be set to change over the particle's lifetime and blend smoothly from "
"one value to another."
msgstr ""
"``Lifetime`` 属性控制每个粒子在消失之前存在的时间长短，以秒为单位。许多粒子属"
"性都可以在粒子生命周期内设置而变化，从一个值平滑过渡到另一个值。"

msgid ""
"``Lifetime`` and ``Amount`` are related. They determine the particle "
"system's emission rate. Whenever you want to know how many particles are "
"spawned per second, this is the formula you would use:"
msgstr ""
"``Lifetime`` 和 ``Amount`` 是相互关联的，决定了粒子系统的发射速率，要知道每秒"
"产生多少粒子，可以使用以下公式："

msgid "Particles per second = \\frac{Amount}{Lifetime}"
msgstr "每秒粒子数 = \\frac{Amount}{Lifetime}"

msgid ""
"Example: Emitting 32 particles with a lifetime of 4 seconds each would mean "
"the system emits 8 particles per second."
msgstr ""
"示例：以每个粒子寿命为4秒的速度发射32个粒子，意味着该系统每秒发射8个粒子。"

msgid ""
"The ``Interp to End`` property causes all the particles in the node to "
"interpolate towards the end of their lifetime."
msgstr "``Interp to End`` 属性会使节点中的所有粒子在其生命周期结束时进行插值。"

msgid ""
"If the checkbox next to the ``One Shot`` property is checked, the particle "
"system will emit ``amount`` particles and then disable itself. It \"runs\" "
"only once. This property is unchecked by default, so the system will keep "
"emitting particles until it is disabled or destroyed manually. One-shot "
"particles are a good fit for effects that react to a single event, like item "
"pickups or splinters that burst away when a bullet hits a wall."
msgstr ""
"如果选中 ``One Shot`` 属性旁边的复选框，则粒子系统将会发射 ``amount`` 数量的"
"粒子，然后自行禁用，会仅运行一次。默认未选中此属性，系统将持续发射粒子，直到"
"手动禁用或销毁。一次性粒子非常适合用于单个事件做出反应的特效，例如，物品拾取"
"或子弹击中墙壁时迸发出的碎片。"

msgid ""
"The ``Preprocess`` property is a way to fast-forward to a point in the "
"middle of the particle system's lifetime and start rendering from there. It "
"is measured in seconds. A value of ``1`` means that when the particle system "
"starts, it will look as if it has been running for one second already."
msgstr ""
"``Preprocess`` 属性用于将时间快速推进到粒子系统生命周期的中间某个点，从那里开"
"始渲染，以秒为单位进行测量。如果值为 ``1`` ，则粒子系统开始运行时，将看起来已"
"经运行了一秒钟。"

msgid ""
"This can be useful if you want the particle system to look like it has been "
"active for a while even though it was just loaded into the scene. Consider "
"the example below. Both particle systems simulate dust flying around in the "
"area. With a preprocess value of ``0``, there wouldn't be any dust for the "
"first couple of seconds because the system has not yet emitted enough "
"particles for the effect to become noticeable. This can be seen in the video "
"on the left. Compare that to the video on the right where the particle "
"system is preprocessed for ``4`` seconds. The dust is fully visible from the "
"very beginning because we skipped the first four seconds of \"setup\" time."
msgstr ""
"尽管刚刚加载到场景中，希望粒子系统看起来已经活跃了一段时间，那么这个功能非常"
"有用。请考虑以下示例。两个粒子系统都模拟了在该区域内飞舞的灰尘。如果预处理值"
"为 ``0`` ，则在前几秒钟内不会有灰尘，因为系统还没有发射足够的粒子以使效果变得"
"明显。这可以在左侧的视频中看到，与其右侧的视频进行比较，其中粒子系统已预处理"
"了 ``4`` 秒。从一开始，灰尘就完全可见了，因为跳过了前四秒的 \"装载\" 时间。"

msgid "No preprocess (left) vs. 4 seconds of preprocess (right)"
msgstr "无预处理（左侧）与 4 秒预处理（右侧）"

msgid ""
"You can slow down or speed up the particle system with the ``Speed Scale`` "
"property. This applies to processing the data as well as rendering the "
"particles. Set it to ``0`` to pause the particle system completely or set it "
"to something like ``2`` to make it move twice as fast."
msgstr ""
"可以设置 ``Speed Scale`` 属性来减慢或加快粒子系统的速度。这既适用于数据处理，"
"也适用于渲染粒子。将其设置为 ``0`` 可以完全暂停粒子系统，或者将其设置为 "
"``2`` ，使其移动速度加快一倍。"

msgid "Different speed scale values: 0.1 (left), 0.5 (middle), 1.0 (right)"
msgstr "不同的速度缩放值：0.1（左侧），0.5（中间），1.0（右侧）"

msgid ""
"The ``Explosiveness`` property controls whether particles are emitted "
"sequentially or simultaneously. A value of ``0`` means that particles emit "
"one after the other. A value of ``1`` means that all ``amount`` particles "
"emit at the same time, giving the effect a more \"explosive\" appearance."
msgstr ""
"``Explosiveness`` 属性控制粒子是顺序发射还是同时发射。值为 ``0`` 表示粒子一个"
"接一个地发射。值为 ``1`` 表示所有 ``amount`` 粒子同时发射，从而使效果看起来更"
"具爆炸性。"

msgid ""
"The ``Randomness`` property adds some randomness to the particle emission "
"timing. When set to ``0``, there is no randomness at all and the interval "
"between the emission of one particle and the next is always the same: the "
"particles are emitted at *regular* intervals. A ``Randomness`` value of "
"``1`` makes the interval completely random. You can use this property to "
"break up some of the uniformity in your effects. When ``Explosiveness`` is "
"set to ``1``, this property has no effect."
msgstr ""
"``Randomness`` 属性为粒子发射时间添加了一些随机性。当设置为 ``0`` 时，完全没"
"有随机性，一个粒子和下一个粒子的发射间隔始终相同：粒子以\\ *固定*\\ 间隔发"
"射。当 ``Randomness`` 值为 ``1`` 时，间隔完全随机。可以使用该属性来打破效果中"
"的一些均匀性。当 ``Explosiveness`` 设置为 ``1`` 时，该属性无效。"

msgid "Particles running at low FPS"
msgstr "粒子以低帧率运行"

msgid ""
"The ``Fixed FPS`` property limits how often the particle system is "
"processed. This includes property updates as well as collision and "
"attractors. This can improve performance a lot, especially in scenes that "
"make heavy use of particle collision. Note that this does not change the "
"speed at which particles move or rotate. You would use the ``Speed Scale`` "
"property for that."
msgstr ""
"``Fixed FPS`` 属性限制了粒子系统的处理频率，包括属性更新以及碰撞和吸引器。这"
"可以有效提高性能，特别是在大量使用粒子碰撞的场景中。请注意，这不会改变粒子移"
"动或旋转的速度。要更改这些属性，应该使用 ``Speed Scale`` 属性。"

msgid ""
"When you set ``Fixed FPS`` to very low values, you will notice that the "
"particle animation starts to look choppy. This can sometimes be desired if "
"it fits the art direction, but most of the time, you'll want particle "
"systems to animate smoothly. That's what the ``Interpolate`` property does. "
"It blends particle properties between updates so that even a particle system "
"running at ``10`` FPS appears as smooth as running at ``60``."
msgstr ""
"当 ``Fixed FPS`` 设置为非常低的值时，你会注意到粒子动画开始看起来不流畅。如果"
"符合艺术设计，有可能是期望的效果，但大多数情况下，会希望粒子系统动画是平滑"
"的。这就是 ``Interpolate`` 属性的作用，它会在更新之间混合粒子属性，因此即使粒"
"子系统以 ``10`` FPS运行，看起来也像是 ``60`` FPS运行一样平滑。"

msgid ""
"When using :ref:`particle collision <doc_3d_particles_collision>`, tunneling "
"can occur if the particles move fast and colliders are thin. This can be "
"remedied by increasing ``Fixed FPS`` (at a performance cost)."
msgstr ""
"使用 :ref:`粒子碰撞 <doc_3d_particles_collision>` 时，如果粒子移动速度快且碰"

"步骤进行。"

msgid ""
"The ``Base Size`` property defines each particle's default collision size, "
"which is used to check whether a particle is currently colliding with the "
"environment. You would usually want this to be about the same size as the "
"particle. It can make sense to increase this value for particles that are "
"very small and move very fast to prevent them from clipping through the "
"collision geometry."
msgstr ""
"``Base Size`` 属性定义了每个粒子的默认碰撞大小，用于检查粒子当前是否与环境发"

"The ``Visibility AABB`` property defines a box around the particle system's "
"origin. As long as any part of this box is in the camera's field of view, "

"view, the particle system stops being rendered at all. You can use this "
"property to boost performance by keeping the box as small as possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"One thing to keep in mind when you set a size for the ``Visibility AABB`` is "
"that particles that are outside of its bounds disappear instantly when it "
"leaves the camera's field of view. Particle collision will also not occur "
"outside the ``Visibility AABB``. While not technically a bug, this can have "
"a negative effect on the visual experience."

"When the ``Local Coords`` property is checked, all particle calculations use "
"the local coordinate system to determine things like up and down, gravity, "
