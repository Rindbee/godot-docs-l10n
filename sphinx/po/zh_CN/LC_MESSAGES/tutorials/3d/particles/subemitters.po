"Sometimes a visual effect cannot be created with a single particle system "
"alone. Sometimes a particle system needs to be spawned as a response to "
"something that happens in another particle system. Fireworks are a good "
"example of that. They usually consist of several stages of explosions that "
"happen in sequence. Sub-emitters are a good way to achieve this kind of "
"effect."
msgstr ""
"有时候，单一的粒子系统无法单独创建出视觉效果。有时候，粒子系统的生成需要作为"
"对另一个粒子系统中发生的某件事的响应。烟花就是一个很好的例子。它们通常由几个"
"按顺序发生的爆炸阶段组成。子发射器是实现这种效果的好方法。"

msgid "Assign sub-emitter"
msgstr "分配子发射器"

msgid "Click to assign a sub-emitter..."
msgstr "点击分配子发射器……"

msgid "List particle systems"
msgstr "粒子系统列表"

msgid "\\...and select one from the scene"
msgstr "……然后从场景中选择一个粒子系统"

msgid ""
"A sub-emitter is a particle system that spawns as a child of another "
"particle system. You can add sub-emitters to sub-emitters, chaining particle "
"effects as deep as you like."
msgstr ""
"子发射器是作为另一个粒子系统子级的粒子系统。你可以为子发射器再添加子发射器，"
"将粒子效果链化，爱叠加多深就叠加多深。"

msgid ""
"To create a sub-emitter, you need at least two particle systems in the same "
"scene. One of them will be the parent and one will be set as the child. Find "
"the ``Sub Emitter`` property on the parent and click the box next to it to "
"assign the sub-emitter. You will see a list of available particle systems in "
"the scene. Select one and click the confirmation button."
msgstr ""
"要创建子发射器，同一场景中至少需要有两个粒子系统。将其中一个作为父级，另一个"
"设为其子级。找到父级上的 ``Sub Emitter`` 属性，然后点击旁边的框，分配子发射"
"器。你会看到场景中可用粒子系统的列表。请选择一个，然后点击确认按钮。"

msgid ""
"Particle systems from instanced scenes can be set as sub-emitters too, as "
"long as the ``Editable Children`` property is enabled on the instanced "
"scene. This also works the other way around: You can assign a sub-emitter to "
"a particle system in an instanced scene, even one coming from a different "
"instanced scene."
msgstr ""
"实例化场景中的粒子系统也可以设置为子发射器，只要在实例化场景中启用了 "
"``Editable Children`` 属性即可。反之亦然：你可以将子发射器分配给实例化场景中"
"的粒子系统，即使是来自其他实例化场景的粒子系统。"

msgid ""
"When you set a particle system as the sub-emitter of another, the system "
"stops emitting, even if the ``Emitting`` property was checked. Don't worry, "
"it didn't break. This happens to every particle system as soon as it becomes "
"a sub-emitter. You also won't be able to re-enable the property as long as "
"the particle system is used as a sub-emitter."
msgstr ""
"当你将一个粒子系统设置为另一个粒子系统的子发射器时，即使选中了 ``Emitting`` "
"属性，系统也会停止发射。不要担心，它没有坏。一旦每个粒子系统成为子发射器，就"
"会发生这种情况。只要将粒子系统用作子发射器，你也无法重新启用该属性。"

msgid ""
"Even though the parent particle system can be selected from the list of "
"available particle systems, a particle system which is its own sub-emitter "
"does not work in Godot. It will simply not spawn. The same is true for any "
"other kind of recursive or self-referential sub-emitter setup."
msgstr ""
"即使可以从可用的粒子系统列表中选择父粒子系统，作为其自身子发射器的粒子系统在 "
"Godot 中也不起作用。它根本不会生成。对于任何其他类型的递归或自参照子发射器设"
"置也是如此。"

msgid "Emitter mode"
msgstr "发射器模式"

msgid ""
"When you assign a sub-emitter, you don't see it spawn right away. Emitting "
"is disabled by default and needs to be enabled first. Set the ``Mode`` "
"property in the ``Sub Emitter`` group of the :ref:`ParticleProcessMaterial "
"<doc_process_material_properties_subemitter>` to something other than "
"``Disabled``."
msgstr ""
"当你分配子发射器时，你不会立即看到它生成。默认情况下，发射处于禁用状态，需要"
"先启用。将 :ref:`ParticleProcessMaterial "
"<doc_process_material_properties_subemitter>` 的 ``Sub Emitter`` 分组中的 "
"``Mode`` 属性设置为 ``Disabled`` 以外的其他属性。"

msgid ""
"The emitter mode also determines how many sub-emitter particles are spawned. "
"``Constant`` spawns a single particle at a frequency set by the "
"``Frequency`` property. For ``At End`` and ``At Collision`` you can set the "
"amount directly with the ``Amount At End`` and the ``Amount At Collision`` "
"properties."
msgstr ""
"发射器模式还决定产生多少个子发射器粒子。\\ ``Constant`` 以 ``Frequency`` 属性"
"设置的频率生成单个粒子。对于 ``At End`` 和 ``At Collision`` ，你可以直接使用 "
"``Amount At End`` 和 ``Amount At Collision`` 属性设置发射量。"

msgid "Limitations"
msgstr "限制"

msgid ""
"One thing to keep in mind is that the total number of active particles from "
"the sub-emitter is always capped by the ``Amount`` property on the sub-"
"emitter particle system. If you find that there are not enough particles "
"spawned from the sub-emitter, you might have to increase the amount in the "
"particle system."
msgstr ""
"要记住的一件事是，来自子发射器的活动粒子总数始终受到子发射器粒子系统上的 "
"``Amount`` 属性的限制。如果你发现从子发射器生成的粒子数量不足，则可能需要增加"
"粒子系统中的数量。"

msgid ""
"Some emitter properties are ignored when a particle system is spawned as a "
"sub-emitter. The ``Explosiveness`` property, for example, has no effect. "
"Depending on the emitter mode, the particles are either spawned sequentially "
"at fixed intervals or explosively all at once."
msgstr ""
"当粒子系统作为子发射器生成时，某些发射器属性将被忽略。例如，\\ "
"``Explosiveness`` 属性不起作用。根据发射器模式的不同，粒子要么以固定的间隔依"
"次生成，要么一次爆炸性全部生成。"
