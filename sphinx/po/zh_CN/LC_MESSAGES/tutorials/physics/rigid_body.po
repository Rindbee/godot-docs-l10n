"A rigid body is one that is directly controlled by the physics engine in "
"order to simulate the behavior of physical objects. In order to define the "
"shape of the body, it must have one or more :ref:`Shape3D <class_Shape3D>` "
"objects assigned. Note that setting the position of these shapes will affect "
"the body's center of mass."
msgstr ""
"刚体是由物理引擎直接控制的物体，用于模拟物体的的物理行为。为了定义刚体的形"
"状，必须为其指定一个或多个 :ref:`Shape3D <class_Shape3D>` 对象。注意，设置这"
"些形状的位置将影响物体的质心。"

"A rigid body's behavior can be altered by setting its properties, such as "
"mass and weight. A physics material needs to be added to the rigid body to "
"adjust its friction and bounce, and set if it's absorbent and/or rough. "
"These properties can be set in the Inspector or via code. "
"See :ref:`RigidBody3D <class_RigidBody3D>` and :ref:`PhysicsMaterial "
"<class_PhysicsMaterial>` for the full list of properties and their effects."

"刚体的行为可以通过设置其属性（例如质量和重量）来进行调整。需要给刚体添加一个"
"物理材质来调整它的摩擦和反弹，并设置它是否具有吸收性、粗糙度。这些属性可以在"
"检查器中或通过代码来设置。参见 :ref:`RigidBody3D <class_RigidBody3D>` "
"和 :ref:`PhysicsMaterial <class_PhysicsMaterial>` 获取完整的属性列表和它们的"
"效果。"

"There are several ways to control a rigid body's movement, depending on your "
"desired application."
msgstr "有几种方法可以控制刚体的运动, 这取决于你的应用程序."

msgid ""
"If you only need to place a rigid body once, for example to set its initial "
"location, you can use the methods provided by the :ref:`Node3D "
"<class_Node3D>` node, such as ``set_global_transform()`` or ``look_at()``. "
"However, these methods cannot be called every frame or the physics engine "
"will not be able to correctly simulate the body's state. As an example, "
"consider a rigid body that you want to rotate so that it points towards "
"another object. A common mistake when implementing this kind of behavior is "
"to use ``look_at()`` every frame, which breaks the physics simulation. "
"Below, we'll demonstrate how to implement this correctly."
msgstr ""
"如果你只需要放置一次刚体，例如设置它的初始位置，你可以使用 :ref:`Node3D "
"<class_Node3D>` 节点提供的方法，例如 ``set_global_transform()`` 或 "
"``look_at()``\\ 。但是，这些方法不能每一帧都被调用，否则物理引擎将无法正确地"
"仿真物体的状态。举个例子，考虑一个刚体，你想旋转它，使它指向另一个对象。在实"
"现这种行为时，一个常见的错误是每一帧都使用 ``look_at()`` ，这样会破坏物理仿"
"真。下面，我们将演示如何正确地实现这一点。"

msgid ""
"The fact that you can't use ``set_global_transform()`` or ``look_at()`` "
"methods doesn't mean that you can't have full control of a rigid body. "
"Instead, you can control it by using the ``_integrate_forces()`` callback. "
"In this method, you can add *forces*, apply *impulses*, or set the "
"*velocity* in order to achieve any movement you desire."
msgstr ""
"你不能使用 ``set_global_transform()`` 或 ``look_at()`` 方法并不意味着你不能完"
"全控制一个刚体. 相反, 你可以通过使用 ``_integrate_forces()`` 回调来控制它. 在"

"As described above, using the Node3D's ``look_at()`` method can't be used "
