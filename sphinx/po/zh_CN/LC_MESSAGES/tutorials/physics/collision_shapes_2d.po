"You can represent the collision of most smaller objects using one or more "
"primitive shapes. However, for more complex objects, such as a large ship or "
"a whole level, you may need convex or concave shapes instead. More on that "
"below."
msgstr ""
"你可以使用一个或多个原始形状来表示大多数较小物体的碰撞. 然而, 对于更复杂的物"
"体, 如大型船舶或整个水平面, 你可能需要凸形或凹形来代替. 下面会有更多的介绍."

msgid ""
"We recommend favoring primitive shapes for dynamic objects such as "
"RigidBodies and CharacterBodies as their behavior is the most reliable. They "
"often provide better performance as well."
msgstr ""
"建议动态对象使用原始图形（如 RigidBodies 和 KinematicBodies），因为它们的行为"
"是可靠的，通常也能提供更好的性能。"

msgid "Convex collision shapes"
msgstr "凸型碰撞形状"

msgid ""
"Godot currently doesn't offer a built-in way to create 2D convex collision "
"shapes. This section is mainly here for reference purposes."
msgstr "Godot 目前没有提供创建 2D 凸形碰撞形状的内置方法。本节内容主要供参考。"

msgid ""
"Depending on the object's complexity, you may get better performance by "
"using multiple convex shapes instead of a concave collision shape. Godot "
"lets you use *convex decomposition* to generate convex shapes that roughly "
"match a hollow object. Note this performance advantage no longer applies "
"after a certain amount of convex shapes. For large and complex objects such "
"as a whole level, we recommend using concave shapes instead."
msgstr ""
"根据对象的复杂程度, 可能要通过使用多个凸形而不是一个凹形碰撞形状来获得更好的"
"性能.Godot可以使用 *凸分解* 来生成与空心物体大致匹配的凸形. 请注意, 在一定数"
"量的凸形之后, 就没有了这种性能优势, 对于大而复杂的对象, 如整个关卡, 建议使用"
"凹形代替."

msgid "Concave or trimesh collision shapes"
msgstr "凹面或三面体碰撞形状"

msgid ""
"Even though concave shapes offer the most accurate *collision*, contact "
"reporting can be less precise than primitive shapes."
msgstr "即使凹形提供了最准确的 *碰撞*, 但触碰信息的精度可能不如基础形状."

msgid ""
"You can configure the CollisionPolygon2D node's *build mode* in the "
"inspector. If it is set to **Solids** (the default), collisions will include "
"the polygon and its contained area. If it is set to **Segments**, collisions "
"will only include the polygon edges."
msgstr ""
"你可以在检查器中配置 CollisionPolygon2D 节点的 *build mode*。如果将其设置为 "
"**Solids**（默认），碰撞将包括多边形及其所包含的区域。如果将其设置为 "
"**Segments**，碰撞将仅包括多边形边缘。"

msgid ""
"**Simplification:** Higher values will result in a less detailed shape, "
"which improves performance at the cost of accuracy."
msgstr "**简化：**值越高，形状的精细度就越低。提高性能的同时降低了精度。"

msgid ""
"**Shrink (Pixels):** Higher values will shrink the generated collision "
"polygon relative to the sprite's edges."
msgstr "**收缩：**数值越大，生成的碰撞多边形就越会相对于精灵边缘收缩。"

msgid ""
"**Grow (Pixels):** Higher values will grow the generated collision polygon "
"relative to the sprite's edges. Note that setting Grow and Shrink to equal "
"values may yield different results than leaving both of them on 0."
msgstr ""
"**增长（像素）：** 数值越大，生成的碰撞多边形就越会相对于精灵边缘增长。需要注"
"意的是，将 “增长 ”和 “收缩 ”设置为相等的值，可能会与将它们都设置为 0 产生的结"
"果不同。"

msgid ""
"If you have an image with many small details, it's recommended to create a "
"simplified version and use it to generate the collision polygon. This can "
"result in better performance and game feel, since the player won't be "
"blocked by small, decorative details."
msgstr ""
"如果你的图片包含许多小细节，建议创建一个简化版本并使用它来生成碰撞多边形。这"
"样可以带来更好的性能表现和游戏体验，因为玩家不会被小小的、装饰性的细节阻碍。"

msgid "Performance caveats"
msgstr "性能方面的注意事项"

msgid ""
"If you run into performance issues, you may have to make tradeoffs in terms "
"of accuracy. Most games out there don't have a 100% accurate collision. They "
"find creative ways to hide it or otherwise make it unnoticeable during "
"normal gameplay."
msgstr ""
"如果遇到性能问题，你可能需要在准确性方面进行权衡。大多数游戏都没有100%的精确"
"碰撞。他们找到了一些具有创造性的方法来隐藏它，或者在正常的游戏中让它变得不被"
"人注意到。"
