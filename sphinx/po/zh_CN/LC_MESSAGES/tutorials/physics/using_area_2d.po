msgid "Using Area2D"
msgstr "使用 Area2D"

msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"Godot offers a number of collision objects to provide both collision "
"detection and response. Trying to decide which one to use for your project "
"can be confusing. You can avoid problems and simplify development if you "
"understand how each of them works and what their pros and cons are. In this "
"tutorial, we'll look at the :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` node and show some "
"examples of how it can be used."
msgstr ""
"Godot提供了许多碰撞对象来提供碰撞检测和响应. 试图决定为你的项目使用哪一个可能"
"会让人感到困惑. 如果你了解它们各自的工作原理以及它们的优点和缺点, 你就可以避"
"免问题并简化开发. 在本教程中, 我们将查看 :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` 节点, "
"并展示一些如何使用它的例子."

msgid ""
"This document assumes you're familiar with Godot's various physics bodies. "
"Please read :ref:`doc_physics_introduction` first."
msgstr ""
"本文假设你熟悉 Godot 中的各种物理体，否则请先阅"
"读 :ref:`doc_physics_introduction` 。"

msgid "What is an area?"
msgstr "什么是区域？"

msgid ""
"An Area2D defines a region of 2D space. In this space you can detect "
"other :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` nodes overlapping, "
"entering, and exiting. Areas also allow for overriding local physics "
"properties. We'll explore each of these functions below."
msgstr ""
"Area2D 定义了二维空间的区域。 在这个空间中，你可以检测到其"
"他 :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>` 节点的重叠，进入和退"
"出。区域 (Area) 还允许覆盖本地物理属性. 我们将在下面讨论这些功能中的每一个。"

msgid "Area properties"
msgstr "Area 的属性"

msgid "Areas have many properties you can use to customize their behavior."
msgstr "区域有许多属性可用于自定义它们的行为."

msgid ""
"The ``Gravity``, ``Linear Damp``, and ``Angular Damp`` sections are used to "
"configure the area's physics override behavior. We'll look at how to use "
"those in the *Area influence* section below."
msgstr ""
"``Gravity`` ，\\ ``Linear Damp`` 和 ``Angular Damp`` 用于配置区域的物理覆盖行"
"为，我们将在下文的 *区域影响* 部分介绍如何使用这些属性。"

msgid ""
"``Monitoring`` and ``Monitorable`` are used to enable and disable the area."
msgstr "``Monitoring`` 和 ``Monitorable`` 用于启用和禁用该区域。"

msgid ""
"The ``Audio Bus`` section allows you to override audio in the area, for "
"example to apply an audio effect when the player moves through."
msgstr ""
"``Audio Bus`` 部分 ，允许覆盖该区域内的音频，例如玩家移动时的音频效果。"

msgid ""
"Note that Area2D extends :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`, "
"so it also provides properties inherited from that class. The ``Collision`` "
"section of ``CollisionObject2D`` is where you configure the area's collision "
"layer(s) and mask(s)."
msgstr ""
"注意，Area2D 扩展了 :ref:`CollisionObject2D <class_CollisionObject2D>`，所以"
"它也提供了从该类继承的属性。在 ``CollisionObject2D`` 的 ``Collision`` 部分，"
"你可以配置该区域的层和遮罩。"

msgid "Overlap detection"
msgstr "重叠检测"

msgid ""
"Perhaps the most common use of Area2D nodes is for contact and overlap "
"detection. When you need to know that two objects have touched, but don't "
"need physical collision, you can use an area to notify you of the contact."
msgstr ""
"也许Area2D节点最常见的用途是用于触碰和重叠检测. 当需要知道两个物体已经触碰, "
"但不需要物理碰撞时, 可以使用一个区域来通知."

msgid ""
"For example, let's say we're making a coin for the player to pick up. The "
"coin is not a solid object - the player can't stand on it or push it - we "
"just want it to disappear when the player touches it."
msgstr ""
"例如, 要做一个硬币让玩家去捡. 硬币并不是一个实心的物体, 玩家不能站在上面, 也"
"不能推它, 只是想让它在玩家触碰它的时候消失."

msgid "Here's the node setup for the coin:"
msgstr "这是硬币节点的设置:"

msgid ""
"To detect the overlap, we'll connect the appropriate signal on the Area2D. "
"Which signal to use depends on the player's node type. If the player is "
"another area, use ``area_entered``. However, let's assume our player is a "
"``CharacterBody2D`` (and therefore a ``CollisionObject2D`` type), so we'll "
"connect the ``body_entered`` signal."
msgstr ""
"为了检测重叠，我们将在 Area2D 上连接相应的信号，使用哪个信号取决于玩家的节点"
"类型。如果玩家是另一个区域（Area2D）, 就使用 ``area_entered``\\ 。然而当假设"
"玩家是一个 ``CharacterBody2D`` （也是一个 ``CollisionObject2D`` 类型）时，我"
"们将连接 ``body_entered`` 信号."

msgid ""
"If you're not familiar with using signals, see :ref:`doc_signals` for an "
"introduction."
msgstr "如果你不熟悉信号的使用，请参阅 :ref:`doc_signals` 的介绍。"

msgid "Now our player can collect the coins!"
msgstr "现在我们的游戏角色可以收集硬币了！"

msgid "Some other usage examples:"
msgstr "其他一些使用实例："

msgid ""
"Areas are great for bullets and other projectiles that hit and deal damage, "
"but don't need any other physics such as bouncing."
msgstr ""
"子弹等抛射物使用区域就很合适，命中就会造成伤害，不需要反弹之类的物理效果。"

msgid ""
"Use a large circular area around an enemy to define its \"detect\" radius. "
"When the player is outside the area, the enemy can't \"see\" it."
msgstr ""
"围绕敌人放一个圆形的区域就可以定义他的“检测”半径。玩家位于该区域之外，敌人就"
"无法“看到”玩家。"

msgid ""
"\"Security cameras\" - In a large level with multiple cameras, attach areas "
"to each camera and activate them when the player enters."
msgstr ""
"“监控摄像头”——假设一个大型关卡中有多个相机，可以为每个相机都附加一个区域，玩"
"家进入某个区域就激活对应的相机。"

msgid ""
"See the :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game` for an example of using Area2D in a "
"game."
msgstr "游戏中使用 Area2D 的示例请参阅 :ref:`doc_your_first_2d_game`\\ 。"

msgid "Area influence"
msgstr "区域影响"

msgid ""
"The second major use for area nodes is to alter physics. By default, the "
"area won't do this, but you can enable this with the ``Space Override`` "
"property. When areas overlap, they are processed in ``Priority`` order "
"(higher priority areas are processed first). There are four options for "
"override:"
msgstr ""
"区域节点的第二个主要用途是改变物理效果。默认情况下区域不会启用这个功能，但你"
"可以用 ``Space Override``\\ （空间覆盖）属性来启用。当区域重叠时，它们会按照 "
"``Priority``\\ （优先级）的顺序进行处理（优先处理优先级高的区域）。覆盖功能有"
"四个选项："

msgid ""
"*Combine* - The area adds its values to what has been calculated so far."
msgstr "*Combine*\\ （合并）——区域会将其数值加到目前计算得到的数值上。"

msgid ""
"*Replace* - The area replaces physics properties, and lower priority areas "
"are ignored."
msgstr "*Replace*\\ （替换）——区域会替换物理属性，忽略优先级更低的区域。"

msgid ""
"*Combine-Replace* - The area adds its gravity/damping values to whatever has "
"been calculated so far (in priority order), ignoring any lower priority "
"areas."
msgstr ""
"*Combine-Replace*\\ （合并后替换）——区域会将重力/阻尼数值加到目前计算得到的数"
"值上（按优先级顺序），忽略优先级更低的区域。"

msgid ""
"*Replace-Combine* - The area replaces any gravity/damping calculated so far, "
"but keeps calculating the rest of the areas."
msgstr ""
"*Replace-Combine*\\ （替换后合并）——区域会替换目前计算得到的重力/阻尼数值，但"
"会继续计算其他区域。"

msgid ""
"Using these properties, you can create very complex behavior with multiple "
"overlapping areas."
msgstr "你可以利用这些属性为相互重叠的区域创建非常复杂的行为。"

msgid "The physics properties that can be overridden are:"
msgstr "可以覆盖的物理属性有："

msgid "*Gravity* - Gravity's strength inside the area."
msgstr "*Gravity*\\ （重力）——区域内的重力强度。"

msgid "*Gravity Direction* - This vector does not need to be normalized."
msgstr "*Gravity Direction*\\ （重力方向）——该向量不需要归一化。"

msgid ""
"*Linear Damp* - How quickly objects stop moving - linear velocity lost per "
"second."
msgstr "*Linear Damp*\\ （线性阻尼）——物体停止移动的快慢——每秒损失的线速度。"

msgid ""
"*Angular Damp* - How quickly objects stop spinning - angular velocity lost "
"per second."
msgstr "*Angular Damp*\\ （角度阻尼）——物体停止旋转的快慢——每秒损失的角速度。"

msgid "Point gravity"
msgstr "重力点"

msgid ""
"The ``Gravity Point`` property allows you to create an \"attractor\". "
"Gravity in the area will be calculated towards a point, given by the ``Point "
"Center`` property. Values are relative to the Area2D, so for example using "
"``(0, 0)`` will attract objects to the center of the area."
msgstr ""
"*重力点 (Gravity Point)* 属性允许你创建一个“吸引器”。区域中的重力将朝向一个"
"由 *点中心 (Point Center)* 属性给出的点进行计算。这些值相对于 Area2D，因此例"
"如使用 ``(0, 0)`` 将吸引物体到区域的中心。"

msgid "Examples"

"override."
