"When you add multiple collision shapes to a single PhysicsBody, you don't "

"You can represent the collision of most smaller objects using one or more "
"primitive shapes. However, for more complex objects, such as a large ship or "
"a whole level, you may need convex or concave shapes instead. More on that "
"below."
msgstr ""
"你可以使用一个或多个原始形状来表示大多数较小物体的碰撞. 然而, 对于更复杂的物"
"体, 如大型船舶或整个水平面, 你可能需要凸形或凹形来代替. 下面会有更多的介绍."

msgid ""
"We recommend favoring primitive shapes for dynamic objects such as "
"RigidBodies and CharacterBodies as their behavior is the most reliable. They "
"often provide better performance as well."
msgstr ""
"建议动态对象使用原始图形（如 RigidBodies 和 KinematicBodies），因为它们的行为"
"是可靠的，通常也能提供更好的性能。"

msgid "Convex collision shapes"
msgstr "凸型碰撞形状"

msgid ""
"Depending on the object's complexity, you may get better performance by "
"using multiple convex shapes instead of a concave collision shape. Godot "
"lets you use *convex decomposition* to generate convex shapes that roughly "
"match a hollow object. Note this performance advantage no longer applies "
"after a certain amount of convex shapes. For large and complex objects such "
"as a whole level, we recommend using concave shapes instead."
msgstr ""
"根据对象的复杂程度, 可能要通过使用多个凸形而不是一个凹形碰撞形状来获得更好的"
"性能.Godot可以使用 *凸分解* 来生成与空心物体大致匹配的凸形. 请注意, 在一定数"
"量的凸形之后, 就没有了这种性能优势, 对于大而复杂的对象, 如整个关卡, 建议使用"
"凹形代替."

msgid ""
"**Create Single Convex Collision Sibling** uses the Quickhull algorithm. It "
"creates one CollisionShape node with an automatically generated convex "
"collision shape. Since it only generates a single shape, it provides good "
"performance and is ideal for small objects."
msgstr ""
"**创建单凸碰撞同级** 使用Quickhull算法, 创建一个CollisionShape碰撞形状节点, "
"并自动生成一个凸碰撞形状, 由于只生成单个形状, 因此提供了良好的性能, 非常适合"
"小对象."

msgid ""
"**Create Multiple Convex Collision Siblings** uses the V-HACD algorithm. It "
"creates several CollisionShape nodes, each with a convex shape. Since it "
"generates multiple shapes, it is more accurate for concave objects at the "
"cost of performance. For objects with medium complexity, it will likely be "
"faster than using a single concave collision shape."
msgstr ""
"**创建多个凸形碰撞同级** 使用V-HACD算法. 创建多个CollisionShape碰撞形状节点, "
"每个节点都有一个凸形, 由于它能生成多个形状, 所以对于凹形物体来说, 精度更高, "
"但性能不佳. 对于中等复杂度的对象, 可能会比使用单个凹形碰撞形状更快."

msgid "Concave or trimesh collision shapes"
msgstr "凹面或三面体碰撞形状"

msgid ""
"Even though concave shapes offer the most accurate *collision*, contact "
"reporting can be less precise than primitive shapes."
msgstr "即使凹形提供了最准确的 *碰撞*, 但触碰信息的精度可能不如基础形状."

msgid ""
"When not using GridMaps for level design, concave shapes are the best "
"approach for a level's collision. That said, if your level has small "
"details, you may want to exclude those from collision for performance and "
"game feel. To do so, you can build a simplified collision mesh in a 3D "
"modeler and have Godot generate a collision shape for it automatically. More "
"on that below"
msgstr ""
"当不使用网络地图进行关卡设计时, 凹形是关卡碰撞的最佳方法, 也就是说, 如果关卡"
"有一些小细节, 可能希望将这些细节排除碰撞之外, 以保证性能和游戏体验, 要做到这"
"一点, 可以在3D建模中建立一个简化的碰撞网格, 并让Godot为其自动生成一个碰撞形"
"状. 下面会有更多的介绍"

msgid ""
"Note that unlike primitive and convex shapes, a concave collision shape "
"doesn't have an actual \"volume\". You can place objects both *outside* of "
"the shape as well as *inside*."
msgstr ""
"请注意, 与基础形状和凸形状不同, 凹形碰撞形状没有实际的 \"体积\", 既可以将对象"
"放置在形状的 *外侧*, 也可以放置在 *内侧*."

"You can generate a concave collision shape from the editor by selecting a "

"If you run into performance issues, you may have to make tradeoffs in terms "

"normal gameplay."
msgstr ""
"如果遇到性能问题，你可能需要在准确性方面进行权衡。大多数游戏都没有100%的精确"
