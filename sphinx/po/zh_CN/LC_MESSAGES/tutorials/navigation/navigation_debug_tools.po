msgid "Navigation debug tools"
msgstr "导航调试工具"

msgid ""
"The debug tools, properties and functions are only available in Godot debug "
"builds. Do not use any of them in code that will be part of a release build."
msgstr ""
"调试工具、调试属性、调试函数都只在调试版本的 Godot 中可用，请勿在发布版本的代"
"码中使用。"

msgid "Enabling navigation debug"
msgstr "启用调试导航"

msgid ""
"The navigation debug visualizations are enabled by default inside the "
"editor. To visualize navigation meshes and connections at runtime too, "
"enable the option **Visible Navigation** in the editor **Debug** menu."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，导航调试可视化在编辑器中启用。若要在运行时可视化导航网格和连接，"
"请在编辑器 **Debug** 菜单中启用选项 **Visible Navigation** 。"

msgid ""
"In Godot debug builds the navigation debug can also be toggled through the "
"NavigationServer singletons from scripts."
msgstr ""
"在Godot调试构建中，导航调试也可以通过脚本中的NavigationServer单例进行切换。"

"Debug visualizations are currently based on Nodes in the SceneTree. If the :"
"ref:`NavigationServer2D<class_NavigationServer2D>` or :ref:"
"`NavigationServer3D<class_NavigationServer3D>` APIs are used exclusively "
"then changes will not be reflected by the debug navigation tools."
msgstr ""
"NavigationServer 即导航服务器。2D 和 3D 版本的 NavigationServer 分别为 :ref:"
"`NavigationServer2D<class_NavigationServer2D>` 和 :ref:"
"`NavigationServer3D<class_NavigationServer3D>`\\ 。"

msgid "Navigation debug settings"
msgstr "导航调试设置"

msgid ""
"The appearance of navigation debug can be changed in the ProjectSettings "
"under ``debug/shapes/navigation``. Certain debug features can also be "
"enabled or disabled at will but may require a scene restart to take effect."
msgstr ""
"导航调试的外观可以在 ``debug/shapes/navigation`` 下的ProjectSettings中更改。"
"某些调试功能也可以随意启用或禁用，但可能需要重新启动场景才能生效。"

msgid "Debug navigation mesh polygons"
msgstr "调试导航网格多边形"

msgid ""
"If ``enable_edge_lines`` is enabled, the edges of navigation mesh polygons "
"will be highlighted. If ``enable_edge_lines_xray`` is also enabled, the "
"edges of navigation meshes will be visible through geometry."
msgstr ""
"如果启用了 ``enable_edge_lines`` ，则导航网格多边形的边将高亮显示。如果还启用"
"了 ``enable_edge_lines_xray`` ，则导航网格的边将通过几何体可见。"

msgid ""
"If ``enable_geometry_face_random_color`` is enabled, the color of each "
"navigation mesh face will be mixed with a random color that is itself mixed "
"with the color specified in ``geometry_face_color``."
msgstr ""
"如果启用了 ``enable_geometry_face_random_color`` ，则每个导航网格面的颜色将与"
"随机颜色混合，该随机颜色本身与 ``geometry_face_color`` 中指定的颜色混合。"

msgid "Debug edge connections"
msgstr "调试边缘连接"

msgid ""
"When two navigation meshes are connected within ``edge_connection_margin`` "
"distance, the connection is overlaid. The color of the overlay is controlled "
"by ``edge_connection_color``. The connections can be made visible through "
"geometry with ``enable_edge_connections_xray``."
msgstr ""
"当两个 navigation 网格在 ``edge_connection_margin`` 距离内连接时，连接被覆"
"盖。覆盖层的颜色由 ``edge_connection_color`` 控制。可以使用 "
"``enable_edge_connections_xray`` 使连接通过几何图形可见。"

msgid "Edge connections are only visible when the NavigationServer is active."
msgstr "只有当NavigationServer处于活动状态时，边缘连接才可见。"

msgid "Debug performance"
msgstr "调试性能"

msgid ""
"To measure NavigationServer performance a dedicated monitor exists that can "
"be found within the Editor Debugger under *Debugger->Monitors->Navigation "
"Process*."
msgstr ""
"要测试NavigationServer性能，可以在编辑器调试器中的 *Debugger->Monitors-"
">Navigation Process* 下找到一个专用监视器。"

msgid ""
"Navigation Process shows how long the NavigationServer spends updating its "
"internals this update frame in milliseconds. Navigation Process works "
"similar to Process for visual frame rendering and Physics Process for "
"collision and fixed updates."
msgstr ""
"Navigation Process以毫秒为单位显示NavigationServer更新其内部的时间。导航过程"
"的工作原理类似于视觉帧渲染过程和碰撞和固定更新的物理过程。"

msgid ""
"Navigation Process accounts for all updates to **navigation maps**, "
"**navigation regions** and **navigation agents** as well as all the "
"**avoidance calculations** for the update frame."
msgstr ""
"Navigation Process负责对 **navigation maps** 、**navigation regions**和 "
"**navigation agents** 的所有更新，以及更新帧的所有 **avoidance "
"calculations** 。"

msgid ""
"Navigation Process does NOT include pathfinding performance cause "
"pathfinding operates on the navigation map data independently from the "
"server process update."
msgstr ""
"导航进程不包括寻路性能，因为寻路操作独立于服务器进程更新的导航地图数据。"

msgid ""
"Navigation Process should be in general kept as low and as stable as "
"possible for runtime performance to avoid frame rate issues. Note that since "
"the NavigationServer process update happens in the middle of the physics "
"update an increase in Navigation Process will automatically increase Physics "
"Process by the same amount."
msgstr ""
"一般情况下，导航进程应尽可能保持低的运行时性能和稳定，以避免帧速率问题。请注"
"意，由于NavigationServer进程更新发生在物理更新的中间，因此Navigation进程的增"
"加将自动使物理进程增加相同的量。"

msgid ""
"Navigation also provides more detailed statistics about the current "
"navigation related objects and navigation map composition on the "
"NavigationServer."
msgstr ""
"导览还提供了关于目前导览相关物件和导览服务器上导览地图组成的更详细的统计数"
"据。"

msgid ""
"Navigation statistics shown here can not be judged as good or bad for "
"performance as it depends entirely on the project what can be considered as "
"reasonable or horribly excessive."
msgstr ""
"此处显示的导览统计数据无法判断性能的好坏，因为它完全取决于项目什么可以被认为"
"是合理的或严重过度的。"

msgid ""
"Navigation statistics help with identifying performance bottlenecks that are "
"less obvious because the source might not always have a visible "
"representation. E.g. pathfinding performance issues created by overly "
"detailed navigation meshes with thousand of edges / polygons or problems "
"caused by procedural navigation gone wrong."
msgstr ""
"导览统计信息有助于识别不太明显的性能瓶颈，因为来源可能并不总是具有可见的表示"
"形式。例如，由具有数千个边/多边形的过于详细的导览网格所建立的寻路性能问题，或"
"由程序导览出错所引起的问题。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
