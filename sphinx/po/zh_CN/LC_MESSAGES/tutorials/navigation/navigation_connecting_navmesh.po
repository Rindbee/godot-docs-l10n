"Different NavigationMeshes are automatically merged by the NavigationServer "
"when at least two vertex positions of one edge exactly overlap."
msgstr ""
"如果不同的 NavigationMesh 至少有一条边的两个顶点位于完全重合的位置，那么 "
"NavigationServer 就会自动将这两个网格合并。"

"To connect over arbitrary distances see :ref:"
"`doc_navigation_using_navigationlinks`."
msgstr ""
"要连接任意距离的两个位置，见 :ref:`doc_navigation_using_navigationlinks`\\ 。"

msgid ""
"The same is true for multiple NavigationPolygon resources. As long as their "
"outline points overlap exactly the NavigationServer will merge them. "
"NavigationPolygon outlines must be from different NavigationPolygon "
"resources to connect."
msgstr ""
"对于多个NavigationPolygon资源也是如此。只要它们的轮廓点完全重叠，导览服务器就"
"会合并它们。NavigationPolygon轮廓必须来自不同的NavigationPolygon资源才能连"
"接。"

msgid ""
"Overlapping or intersecting outlines on the same NavigationPolygon will fail "
"the navigation mesh creation. Overlapping or intersecting outlines from "
"different NavigationPolygons will often fail to create the navigation region "
"edge connections on the NavigationServer and should be avoided."
msgstr ""
"同一NavigationPolygon上的重叠或相交轮廓将导致导览网格建立失败。来自不同导览多"
"边形的重叠或相交轮廓通常无法在导览服务器上建立导览区域边缘连接，因此应避免。"

msgid ""
"Exactly means exactly for the vertex position merge. Small float errors that "
"happen quite regularly with imported meshes will prevent a successful vertex "
"merge."
msgstr ""
"精确意味着精确地进行顶点位置合并。汇入的网格经常发生的小 float 错误将阻止成功"
"的顶点合并。"

msgid ""
"Alternatively navigation meshes are not merged but still considered as "
"**connected** by the NavigationServer when their edges are nearly parallel "
"and within distance to each other. The connection distance is defined by "
"the  ``edge_connection_margin`` for each navigation map. In many cases "
"navigation mesh edges cannot properly connect when they partly overlap. "
"Better avoid any navigation mesh overlap at all time for a consistent merge "
"behavior."
msgstr ""
"当导航网格的边几乎平行，且间距在一定范围内时，NavigationServer 可以不合并导航"
"网格，仍将其视为相互\\ *连接*\\ 。这一连接距离由每个导航地图的 "
"``edge_connection_margin`` 定义。在许多情况下，导航网格的边在部分重叠时无法正"
"确连接。为了实现一致的合并行为，最好避免让导航网格之间发生重叠。"

"If navigation debug is enabled and the NavigationServer active the "
"established navigation mesh connections will be visualized. See :ref:"
