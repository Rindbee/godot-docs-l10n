msgid ""
"An avoidance obstacle is considered static when its ``vertices`` property is "

"Static obstacles can not change their position. They can only be warped to a "

"When the 2D avoidance is used in 3D the y-axis of Vector3 vertices is "

"height properties."

"当在3D中使用2D回避时，Vector3顶点的y轴将被忽略。相反，障碍物的全局y轴位置用作"
