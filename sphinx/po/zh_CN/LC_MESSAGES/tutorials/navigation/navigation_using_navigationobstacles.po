msgid "Using NavigationObstacles"
msgstr "使用 NavigationObstacle"

msgid ""
"NavigationObstacles can be used either as static or dynamic obstacles to "
"affect avoidance controlled agents."
msgstr ""
"NavigationObstacle 即导航障碍物，可以用作静态或动态障碍物，影响由避障系统控制"
"的代理。"

msgid ""
"When used statically NavigationObstacles constrain avoidance controlled "
"agents outside or inside a polygon defined area."
msgstr "当静态使用时，导览障碍会限制多边形定义区域外部或内部的回避控制代理。"

msgid ""
"When used dynamically NavigationObstacles push away avoidance controlled "
"agents in a radius around them."
msgstr "当动态使用时，导览障碍会推开其周围半径范围内的回避控制代理。"

msgid ""
"2D and 3D versions of NavigationObstacles nodes are available as :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle2D<class_NavigationObstacle2D>` and :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle3D<class_NavigationObstacle3D>`  respectively."
msgstr ""
"2D 和 3D 版本的 NavigationObstacle 节点分别为 :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle2D<class_NavigationObstacle2D>` 和 :ref:"
"`NavigationObstacle3D<class_NavigationObstacle3D>` 。"

msgid ""
"NavigationObstacles do not change or influence the pathfinding in any way. "
"NavigationObstacles only affect the avoidance velocities of agents "
"controlled by avoidance."
msgstr ""
"导航障碍不会以任何方式改变或影响寻路。导航障碍只影响由回避控制的主体的回避速"
"度。"

msgid "Static obstacles"
msgstr "静态障碍物"

msgid ""
"A NavigationObstacle is considered static when its ``vertices`` property is "
"populated with an outline array of positions to form a polygon."
msgstr ""
"当NavigationObstruct的 ``vertices`` 属性由位置的轮廓数组填充以形成多边形时，"
"它被视为静态的。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles act as hard do-not-cross boundaries for avoidance using "
"agents, e.g. similar to physics collision but for avoidance."
msgstr ""
"静态障碍物起着硬性作用——使代理无法跨越边界而回避，例如类似于物理碰撞，但用于"
"回避。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles define their boundaries with an array of outline "
"``vertices`` (positions), and in case of 3D with an additional ``height`` "
"property."
msgstr ""
"静态障碍物用一组轮廓 ``vertices`` （位置）定义其边界，在3D的情况下，用额外的 "
"``height`` 属性定义其边界。"

msgid "Static obstacles only work for agents that use the 2D avoidance mode."
msgstr "静态障碍物仅适用于使用2D回避模式的代理。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles define through winding order of the vertices if agents are "
"pushed out or sucked in."
msgstr "如果代理人被推出或吸入，静态障碍物透过顶点的缠绕顺序来定义。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles can not change their position. They can only be warped to a "
"new position and rebuild from scratch. Static obstacles as a result are ill-"
"suited for usages where the position is changed every frame as the constant "
"rebuild has a high performance cost."
msgstr ""
"静态障碍物不能改变其位置。它们只能扭曲到新的位置并从头开始重建。因此，静态障"
"碍物不适合每影格位置都会改变的用途，因为不断重建会产生很高的性能成本。"

msgid ""
"Static obstacles that are warped to another position can not be predicted by "
"agents. This creates the risk of getting agents stuck should a static "
"obstacle be warped on top of agents."
msgstr ""
"代理无法预测扭曲到另一个位置的静态障碍物。如果静态障碍物扭曲到代理顶部，这就"
"会产生代理被卡住的风险。"

msgid ""
"When the 2D avoidance is used in 3D the y-axis of Vector3 vertices is "
"ignored. Instead, the global y-axis position of the obstacle is used as the "
"elevation level. Agents will ignore static obstacles in 3D that are below or "
"above them. This is automatically determined by global y-axis position of "
"both obstacle and agent as the elevation level as well as their respective "
"height properties."
msgstr ""
"当在3D中使用2D回避时，Vector3顶点的y轴将被忽略。相反，障碍物的全局y轴位置用作"
"海拔高度。代理将忽略3D中低于或高于其的静态障碍物。这是由障碍物和代理的全局y轴"
"位置自动确定为海拔高度以及它们各自的高度属性。"

msgid "Dynamic obstacles"
msgstr "动态障碍物"

msgid ""
"A NavigationObstacle is considered dynamic when its ``radius`` property is "
"greater than zero."
msgstr "NavigationObstacle 的 ``radius`` 属性大于零时就会被认为是动态障碍物。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles act as a soft please-move-away-from-me object for "
"avoidance using agents, e.g. similar to how they avoid other agents."
msgstr ""
"对于启用了避障的代理而言，动态障碍物就是一个“请离我远点”的对象，类似于它们自"
"己躲避其他代理的行为。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles define their boundaries with a single ``radius`` for a 2D "
"circle, or in case of 3D avoidance a sphere shape."
msgstr "动态障碍物使用 ``radius`` 半径来定义边界，2D 中是圆形，3D 中是球形。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles can change their position every frame without additional "
"performance cost."
msgstr "动态障碍物每一帧都可以改变位置，不会有额外的性能开销。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles with a set velocity can be predicted in their movement by "
"agents."
msgstr "动态障碍物设置速度后，其他代理就能够预测移动。"

msgid ""
"Dynamic obstacles are not a reliable way to constrain agents in crowded or "
"narrow spaces."
msgstr "动态障碍物不适合用来将代理限制在拥挤、狭窄的空间中。"

msgid ""
"While both static and dynamic properties can be active at the same time on "
"the same obstacle this is not recommended for performance. Ideally when an "
"obstacle is moving the static vertices are removed and instead the radius "
"activated. When the obstacle reaches the new final position it should "
"gradually enlarge its radius to push all other agents away. With enough "
"created save space around the obstacle it should add the static vertices "
"again and remove the radius. This helps to avoid getting agents stuck in the "
"suddenly appearing static obstacle when the rebuild static boundary is "
"finished."
msgstr ""
"虽然障碍物可以同时激活静态和动态属性，但是出于性能的考虑不建议这么做。理想情"
"况下，障碍物移动时，应该把静态顶点移除、激活半径。障碍物到达目的地后，应该逐"
"步增大半径，将其他代理推开。在障碍物的周围创造出足够大的安全区域后，就应该把"
"静态顶点添加回来、移除半径。这样就能够避免重建静态边界后，代理因为静态障碍物"
"的突然出现而被卡住。"

msgid ""
"Similar to agents the obstacles can make use of the ``avoidance_layers`` "
"bitmask. All agents with a matching bit on their own avoidance mask will "
"avoid the obstacle."
msgstr ""
"和代理类似，障碍物也能够使用 ``avoidance_layers`` 位掩码。自身的避障掩码中与"
"之存在匹配位的代理都会躲避这个障碍物。"

msgid "Procedural obstacles"
msgstr "程序式障碍物"

msgid ""
"New obstacles can be created without a Node directly on the NavigationServer."
msgstr "可以不借助节点，直接在 NavigationServer 上新建障碍物。"

msgid ""
"Obstacles created with scripts require at least a ``map`` and a "
"``position``. For dynamic use a ``radius`` is required. For static use an "
"array of ``vertices`` is required."
msgstr ""
"使用脚本创建的障碍物至少需要有一个 ``map`` 和一个 ``position``\\ 。动态障碍物"
"还需要 ``radius``\\ 。静态障碍物还需要 ``vertices`` 属性。"
