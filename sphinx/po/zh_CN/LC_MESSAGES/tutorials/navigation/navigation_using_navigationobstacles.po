msgid ""
"Static obstacles can not change their position. They can only be warped to a "

"suited for usages where the position is changed every frame, as the constant "
"rebuild has a high performance cost."
msgstr ""
"静态障碍物不能改变位置，只能先传送到新的位置，然后重新构建。因此，静态障碍物"
"不适合位置每帧都会改变的场合，因为不断重建会产生很高的性能成本。"

msgid ""
"When the 2D avoidance is used in 3D the y-axis of Vector3 vertices is "
"ignored. Instead, the global y-axis position of the obstacle is used as the "

msgid ""
"While both static and dynamic properties can be active at the same time on "
"the same obstacle this is not recommended for performance. Ideally when an "
"obstacle is moving the static vertices are removed and instead the radius "
"activated. When the obstacle reaches the new final position it should "
"gradually enlarge its radius to push all other agents away. With enough "
"created safe space around the obstacle it should add the static vertices "
"again and remove the radius. This helps avoid getting agents stuck in the "
"suddenly appearing static obstacle when the rebuilt static boundary is "
"finished."
msgstr ""
"虽然障碍物可以同时激活静态和动态属性，但是出于性能的考虑不建议这么做。理想情"
"况下，障碍物移动时应该移除静态顶点、激活半径。障碍物到达目的地后则应该逐步增"

"Similar to agents the obstacles can make use of the ``avoidance_layers`` "
