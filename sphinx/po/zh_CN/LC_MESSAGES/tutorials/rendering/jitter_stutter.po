msgid "What is jitter, stutter and input lag?"
msgstr "什么是抖动、卡顿和输入延迟？"

msgid ""
"*Jitter* and *stutter* are two different alterations to visible motion of "
"objects on screen that may affect a game, even when running at full speed. "
"These effects are mostly visible in games where the world moves at a "
"constant speed in a fixed direction, like runners or platformers."
msgstr ""
"*抖动*\\ （Jitter）和\\ *卡顿*\\ （stutter）是即使游戏在全速运行时，也可能出"
"现在屏幕上物体可见运动中的两种不同变化，可能会影响游戏体验。这些问题在世界以"
"恒定速度朝着固定方向运动的游戏中影响最明显, 比如跑酷或平台类游戏."

msgid ""
"*Input lag* is unrelated to jitter and stutter, but is sometimes discussed "
"alongside. Input lag refers to visible on-screen delay when performing "
"actions with the mouse, keyboard, controller or touchscreen. It can be "
"related to game code, engine code or external factors (such as hardware). "
"Input lag is most noticeable in games that use the mouse to aim, such as "
"first-person games. Input lag can't be completely eliminated, but it can be "
"reduced in several ways."
msgstr ""
"*输入延迟*\\与抖动和卡顿无关，但也是经常为人讨论的话题。输入延迟指在鼠标、键"
"盘、控制器与触屏在与游戏进行互动时，在屏幕上所呈现的视觉延迟，产生的原因与游"
"戏代码、引擎代码及外部因素（如硬件因素）等方面有关。尤其是在第一人称游戏当"
"中，输入延迟尤为明显。输入延迟无法消除，但可以通过某些手段来减少输入延迟。"

msgid "Distinguishing between jitter and stutter"
msgstr "抖动和卡顿的区分"

msgid ""
"A game running at a normal framerate without exhibiting any effect will "
"appear smooth:"
msgstr "一款在正常帧下运行, 而不显示任何效果的游戏将显得平滑:"

msgid "A game exhibiting *jitter* will shake constantly in a very subtle way:"
msgstr "游戏展示了\\ *抖动*\\ 将以非常细微的方式持续抖动："

msgid ""
"Finally, a game exhibiting *stutter* will appear smooth, but appear to "
"*stop* or *roll back a frame* every few seconds:"
msgstr ""
"最后，存在“卡顿”的游戏看上去是流畅的，但似乎每隔几秒钟就会\\ *停顿*\\ 或\\ *"
"回滚一帧*\\ ："

msgid "Jitter"
msgstr "抖动"

msgid ""
"There can be many causes of jitter, the most typical one happens when the "
"game *physics frequency* (usually 60 Hz) runs at a different resolution than "
"the monitor refresh rate. Check whether your monitor refresh rate is "
"different from 60 Hz."
msgstr ""
"产生抖动的原因有很多，最典型的情况发生在运行游戏时的\\ *物理频率*\\ （通常为 "
"60 Hz）以与显示器刷新率不同。检查你的显示器刷新率是否为 60 Hz。"

msgid ""
"This is generally not a problem, given that most monitors are 60 Hz, and "
"starting with Godot 3.1, a frame timer was introduced that tries to "
"synchronize with refresh as well as possible."
msgstr ""
"这通常不是一个问题, 因为大多数显示器都是60赫兹, 而且从Godot 3.1开始, 引入了一"
"个帧定时器, 尽量与刷新同步."

msgid "Stutter"
msgstr "卡顿"

msgid ""
"Stutter may happen due to two different reasons. The first, and most obvious "
"one, is the game not being able to keep full framerate performance. Solving "
"this is game specific and will require optimization."
msgstr ""
"产生卡顿有两个不同原因。第一个，也是最明显的一个，就是游戏无法保持完整的帧率"
"性能。解决方法是因游戏而异的，需要进行优化。"

msgid ""
"The second is more complicated, because it is often not associated to the "
"engine or game but the underlying operating system. Here is some information "
"regarding stutter on different OSs."
msgstr ""
"第二个原因更复杂，因为它通常与引擎或游戏无关，而与底层操作系统有关。下面是不"
"同操作系统上，关于卡顿的一些信息。"

msgid "Windows"
msgstr "Windows"

msgid ""
"Windows is known to cause stutter in windowed games. This mostly depends on "
"the hardware installed, drivers version and processes running in parallel (e."
"g. having many browser tabs open may cause stutter in a running game). To "
"avoid this, starting with 3.1, Godot raises the game priority to \"Above "
"Normal\". This helps considerably but may not completely eliminate stutter."
msgstr ""
"众所周知，Windows 操作系统在窗口化游戏时会产生卡顿。这主要取决于你所安装的硬"
"件，驱动程序版本和并行运行的进程（例如，打开多个浏览器标签页可能导致游戏在运"
"行时出现卡顿）。为了避免这种情况，从 3.1 版本开始，Godot 将游戏的优先级提升到"
"了“高于标准”。这样能够相当程度缓解问题，但可能无法完全消除卡顿现象。"

msgid ""
"Eliminating this completely requires giving your game full privileges to "
"become \"time critical\", which is not advised. Some games may do it, but it "
"is advised to learn to live with this problem, as it is common for Windows "
"games and most users won't play games windowed (games that are played in a "
"window, e.g. puzzle games, will usually not exhibit this problem anyway)."
msgstr ""
"完全消除这种情况需要给你的游戏以充分的权限, 使之成为 \"time critical\" , 这是"
"不建议的. 有些游戏可能会这样做, 但建议学会忍受这个问题, 因为这对Windows游戏来"
"说很常见, 而且大多数用户不会在窗口中玩游戏(反正在窗口中玩的游戏, 如益智游戏, "
"通常不会出现这个问题)."

msgid ""
"For fullscreen, Windows gives special priority to the game so stutter is no "
"longer visible and very rare. This is how most games are played."
msgstr ""
"对于全屏来说，Windows 系统对游戏给予了特殊的优先级，所以卡顿现象不再可见，也"
"非常罕见。大多数游戏都是这样玩的。"
