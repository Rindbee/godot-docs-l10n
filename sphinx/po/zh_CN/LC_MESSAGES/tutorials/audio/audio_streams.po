"As you might have already read in :ref:`doc_audio_buses`, sound is sent to "

"An audio stream is an abstract object that emits sound. The sound can come "
"from many places, but is most commonly loaded from the filesystem. Audio "
"files can be loaded as AudioStreams and placed inside an AudioStreamPlayer. "
"You can find information on supported formats and differences in :ref:"
"`doc_importing_audio_samples`."

"Area2Ds can be used to divert sound from any AudioStreamPlayer2Ds they "
