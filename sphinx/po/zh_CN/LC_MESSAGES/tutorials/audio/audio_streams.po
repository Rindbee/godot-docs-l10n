"As you might have already read in :ref:`doc_audio_buses`, sound is sent to "
"each bus via an AudioStreamPlayer node. There are different kinds of "
"AudioStreamPlayers. Each one loads an AudioStream and plays it back."
msgstr ""
"你可能已经在《\\ :ref:`doc_audio_buses`\\ 》中读到过，声音通过 "
"AudioStreamPlayer 节点发送到每条总线。有不同类型的 AudioStreamPlayer。每种 "
"AudioStreamPlayer 都会加载一个 AudioStream 并播放它。"

msgid "AudioStream"
msgstr "AudioStream（音频流）"

msgid ""
"An audio stream is an abstract object that emits sound. The sound can come "
"from many places, but is most commonly loaded from the filesystem. Audio "
"files can be loaded as AudioStreams and placed inside an AudioStreamPlayer. "
"You can find information on supported formats and differences "
"in :ref:`doc_importing_audio_samples`."
msgstr ""
"音频流是一种产生声音的抽象对象。声音可以来自许多地方，但最常见的是从文件系统"
"加载。音频文件可以作为 AudioStream 加载并放置在 AudioStreamPlayer 中。你可以"

"息。"

msgid ""
"There are other types of AudioStreams, such "
"as :ref:`AudioStreamRandomizer<class_AudioStreamRandomizer>`. This one picks "
"a different audio stream from a list of streams each time it's played back, "
"and applies random pitch and volume shifting. This can be helpful for adding "
"variation to sounds that are played back often."
msgstr ""
"还有其他类型的 AudioStream，例"
"如 :ref:`AudioStreamRandomizer<class_AudioStreamRandomizer>`\\ 。这种音频流每"
"次都会从音频流列表中挑选不同的音频流进行播放，并应用随机音高和音量调整，这有"
"助于为经常播放的声音添加变化。"

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer（音频流播放器）"

msgid ""
"This is the standard, non-positional stream player. It can play to any bus. "
"In 5.1 sound setups, it can send audio to stereo mix or front speakers."
msgstr ""
"这是一种标准的非位置型的流播放器。它可以播放到任何总线。在 5.1 声音设置中，它"
"可以将音频发送到立体声混音或前置扬声器。"

msgid ""
"Playback Type is an experimental setting, and could change in future "
"versions of Godot. It exists so Web exports use Web Audio-API based samples "
"instead of streaming all sounds to the browser, unlike most platforms. This "
"prevents the audio from being garbled in single-threaded Web exports. By "
"default, only the Web platform will use samples. Changing this setting is "
"not recommended, unless you have an explicit reason to. You can change the "
"default playback type for the web and other platforms in the project "
"settings under **Audio > General** (advanced settings must be turned on to "
"see the setting)."
msgstr ""
"播放类型是一种实验性设置，可能会在 Godot 的未来版本中发生变化。它的存在使得 "
"Web 导出使用基于 Web Audio-API 的样本，而不是像大多数平台那样将所有声音流式传"
"输到浏览器。这可以防止音频在单线程 Web 导出中出现乱码。默认情况下，只有 Web "
"平台会使用样本。除非有明确的理由，否则不建议更改此设置。你可以在项目设置的\\ "
"**音频 > 常规**\\ （必须打开高级设置才能看到）下更改 Web 和其他平台的默认播放"

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer2D"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer2D"

"This is a variant of AudioStreamPlayer, but emits sound in a 2D positional "
"environment. When close to the left of the screen, the panning will go left. "
"When close to the right side, it will go right."
msgstr ""
"这是 AudioStreamPlayer 的一种变体，但在 2D 位置环境中发出声音。当靠近屏幕左侧"
"时，声像将向左移动。当靠近右侧时，声像将向右移动。"

msgid ""
"Area2Ds can be used to divert sound from any AudioStreamPlayer2Ds they "
"contain to specific buses. This makes it possible to create buses with "
"different reverb or sound qualities to handle action happening in a "
"particular parts of your game world."
msgstr ""
"Area2D 可用于将声音从其包含的任何 AudioStreamPlayer2D 转移到特定总线。这样就"

msgid "AudioStreamPlayer3D"
msgstr "AudioStreamPlayer3D"

msgid ""
"This is a variant of AudioStreamPlayer, but emits sound in a 3D positional "

"it can position sound in stereo, 5.1 or 7.1 depending on the chosen audio "
"setup."
msgstr ""
"这是 AudioStreamPlayer 的一种变体，但在 3D 位置环境中发出声音。根据播放器相对"

msgid ""
"Similar to AudioStreamPlayer2D, an Area3D can divert the sound to an audio "
"bus."
msgstr "与 AudioStreamPlayer2D 类似，Area3D 可以将声音转移到特定的音频总线上。"

"Godot allows for 3D audio streams that enter a specific Area3D node to send "
"dry and wet audio to separate buses. This is useful when you have several "
"reverb configurations for different types of rooms. This is done by enabling "
"this type of reverb in the **Reverb Bus** section of the Area3D's properties:"
msgstr ""
"Godot 允许进入特定 Area3D 节点的 3D 音频流，将干音频和湿音频发送到单独的总线"
"上。这有益于为不同类型的房间配置多种混响配置。这可以通过在 Area3D 属性的 "
"**Reverb Bus**\\ （混响总线）部分中启用这种类型的混响来实现："

msgid ""
"At the same time, a special bus layout is created where each Area3D receives "
"the reverb info from each Area3D. A Reverb effect needs to be created and "
"configured in each reverb bus to complete the setup for the desired effect:"

"同时，还创建了一个特殊的总线布局，其中每个 Area3D 都从每个 Area3D 接收混响信"

msgid ""
"The Area3D's **Reverb Bus** section also has a parameter named "
"**Uniformity**. Some types of rooms bounce sounds more than others (like a "
"warehouse), so reverberation can be heard almost uniformly across the room "
"even though the source may be far away. Playing around with this parameter "
"can simulate that effect."
msgstr ""
"Area3D 的 **Reverb Bus**\\ （混响总线）部分还有一个名为 **Uniformity**\\ （统"

"When the relative velocity between an emitter and listener changes, this is "

"Godot can track velocity changes in the AudioStreamPlayer3D and Camera "
"nodes. Both nodes have this property, which must be enabled manually:"
msgstr ""
"当发射源和侦听者之间的相对速度发生变化时，这被视为发出的声音的音高增加或减"
