msgid "Audio effects"
msgstr "音频特效"

msgid ""
"Godot includes several audio effects that can be added to an audio bus to "
"alter every sound file that goes through that bus."
msgstr ""
"Godot 包含多种音频效果，可以将它们添加到音频总线以更改通过该总线的每个音频文"
"件。"

msgid ""
"Try them all out to get a sense of how they alter sound. Here follows a "
"short description of the available effects:"
msgstr "全部试一试，感受声音的改变。下面是对可用效果的简短描述："

msgid "Amplify"
msgstr "Amplify（增幅）"

msgid ""
"Amplify changes the volume of the signal. Some care needs to be taken, "
"though: setting the level too high can make the sound digitally clip, which "
"can produce unpleasant crackles and pops."
msgstr ""
"增幅改变信号的音量。不过使用时要小心：把电平调得太高的话，声音就会出现数字削"
"波，从而产生令人不快的噼啪声和爆音。"

msgid "BandLimit and BandPass"
msgstr "BandLimit and BandPass（带限和带通）"

msgid ""
"These are resonant filters which block frequencies around the *Cutoff* "
"point. BandPass can be used to simulate sound passing through an old "
"telephone line or megaphone. Modulating the BandPass frequency can simulate "
"the sound of a wah-wah guitar pedal, think of the guitar in Jimi Hendrix's "
"*Voodoo Child (Slight Return)*."
msgstr ""
"这些是谐振滤波器，可阻止\\ *截断*\\ （Cutoff）点附近的频率。带通滤波器可用于"
"模拟通过旧电话线或扩音器的声音。调制带通频率可以模拟哇音（wah-wah）吉他踏板的"
"声音，想想吉米·亨德里克斯（Jimi Hendrix）的 *Voodoo Child (Slight Return)* 中"
"使用的吉他吧。"

msgid "Capture"
msgstr "捕获"

msgid ""
"The Capture effect copies the audio frames of the audio bus that it is on "
"into an internal buffer. This can be used to capture data from the "
"microphone or to transmit audio over the network in real-time."
msgstr ""
"Capture（捕获）效果器会将其所在音频总线的音频帧复制到内部缓冲区中。可用于从麦"
"克风捕获数据或通过网络实时传输音频。"

msgid "Chorus"
msgstr "Chorus（和声）"

msgid ""
"As the name of the effect implies, the Chorus effect makes a single audio "
"sample sound like an entire chorus. It does this by duplicating a signal and "
"very slightly altering the timing and pitch of each duplicate, and varying "
"that over time via an LFO (low frequency oscillator). The duplicate(s) are "
"then mixed back together with the original signal, producing a lush, wide, "
"and large sound. Although chorus is traditionally used for voices, it can be "
"desirable with almost any type of sound."
msgstr ""
"正如该效果的名称所暗示的那样，和声效果将使单个音频样本听起来像整个合唱。它通"
"过复制信号并稍微改变每个副本的时间和音高，并通过 LFO（低频振荡器）随时间变化"
"来实现此目的。然后，复制信号与原始信号混合在一起，产生丰富、宽广、宏大的声"
"音。尽管和声传统上用于声音，但几乎任何类型的声音都可以使用和声。"

msgid "Compressor"
msgstr "Compressor（压缩器）"

msgid ""
"A dynamic range compressor automatically attenuates (ducks) the level of the "
"incoming signal when its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The level of "
"attenuation applied is proportional to how far the incoming audio exceeds "
"the threshold. The compressor's Ratio parameter controls the degree of "
"attenuation. One of the main uses of a compressor is to reduce the dynamic "
"range of signals with very loud and quiet parts. Reducing the dynamic range "
"of a signal can make it fit more comfortably in a mix."
msgstr ""
"当输入信号的幅度超过某一阈值时，动态范围压缩器会自动衰减（避开）该信号的电"
"平。所施加的衰减水平与传入音频超过阈值的程度成正比。压缩器的“比例”参数控制衰"
"减的程度。压缩器的主要用途之一是，当一个信号具有非常大声和小声的部分时，压缩"
"器可以用于降低其动态范围。降低信号的动态范围可以使其更方便混音。"

msgid "The compressor has many uses. For example:"
msgstr "压缩器有很多用途。例如："

msgid ""
"It can be used in the Master bus to compress the whole output prior to being "
"hit by a limiter, making the effect of the limiter much more subtle."
msgstr ""
"它可用于主总线中，在受到限制器影响之前压缩整个输出，从而使限制器的效果更加微"
"妙。"

msgid ""
"It can be used in voice channels to ensure they sound as even as possible."
msgstr "它可用于语音通道，以确保它们听起来尽可能均匀。"

msgid ""
"It can be *sidechained* by another sound source. This means it can reduce "
"the sound level of one signal using the level of another audio bus for "
"threshold detection. This technique is very common in video game mixing to "
"\"duck\" the level of music or sound effects when in-game or multiplayer "
"voices need to be fully audible."
msgstr ""
"它可以通过另一个声源来\\ *侧链*\\ （Sidechain）。也就是说, 它可以利用另一个音"
"频总线的电平进行阈值检测，来降低一个信号的电平。这种技术在电子游戏混音中非常"
"常见。当游戏中或多人游戏的声音需要被玩家清楚听到时，可以“降低”（Duck）音乐或"
"音效的电平。"

msgid ""
"It can accentuate transients by using a slower attack. This can make sound "
"effects more punchy."
msgstr "它可以通过较慢的启动（attack）来突出瞬态，让音效听起来更有力。"

msgid ""
"If your goal is to prevent a signal from exceeding a given amplitude "
"altogether, rather than to reduce the dynamic range of the signal, a :ref:"
"`limiter <doc_audio_buses_limiter>` is likely a better choice than a "
"compressor for this purpose. However, applying compression before a limiter "
"is still good practice."
msgstr ""
"如果你的目标是防止电平信号完全超过某个给定幅度，而不是减少信号的动态范围，那"
"么，\\ :ref:`限幅器（limiter）<doc_audio_buses_limiter>`\\ 可能比压缩器更适合"
"该目的。然而，在限幅器之前应用压缩依然是很好的实践。"

msgid "Delay"
msgstr "Delay（延迟）"

msgid ""
"Digital delay essentially duplicates a signal and repeats it at a specified "
"speed with a volume level that decays for each repeat. Delay is great for "
"simulating the acoustic space of a canyon or large room, where sound bounces "
"have a lot of *delay* between their repeats. This is in contrast to reverb, "
"which has a more natural and blurred sound to it. Using this in conjunction "
"with reverb can create very natural sounding environments!"
msgstr ""
"数字延迟本质上是复制一个信号，并以指定的速度重复播放它，且每次重复时音量都会"
"衰减。延迟非常适合模拟如峡谷或大房间这样的声学空间，其中声音的反弹在每次重复"
"之间都有很多\\ *延迟*\\ 。这点与混响相反，混响的声音更自然、更模糊。将其与混"
"响结合使用可以创建非常自然的声音环境！"

msgid "Distortion"
msgstr "Distortion（失真）"

msgid "Makes the sound distorted. Godot offers several types of distortion:"
msgstr "使声音失真。Godot 提供了几种类型的失真："

msgid ""
"*Overdrive* sounds like a guitar distortion pedal or megaphone. Sounds "
"distorted with this sound like they're coming through a low-quality speaker "
"or device."
msgstr ""
"*Overdrive* 过载，听起来像吉他失真踏板或扩音器。这种声音失真，听起来像是通过"
"低质量的扬声器或设备发出的。"

msgid "*Tan* sounds like another interesting flavor of overdrive."
msgstr "*Tan* 正弦，听起来像是另一种有趣的过载风格。"

msgid ""
"*Bit crushing* clamps the amplitude of the signal, making it sound flat and "
"crunchy."
msgstr "*Bit crushing* 位破碎，会限制信号的幅度，使其听起来平坦且嘎吱作响。"

msgid ""
"All three types of distortion can add higher frequency sounds to an original "
"sound, making it stand out better in a mix."
msgstr ""
"所有这三种类型的失真都可以为原始声音添加更高频率的声音，使其在混音中更加突"
"出。"

msgid "EQ"
msgstr "EQ（均衡器）"

msgid ""
"EQ is what all other equalizers inherit from. It can be extended with Custom "
"scripts to create an equalizer with a custom number of bands."
msgstr ""
"所有其他均衡器都继承自 EQ。可以使用自定义脚本对其进行扩展，以创建一个具有自定"
"义频段数的均衡器。"

msgid "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"
msgstr "EQ6、EQ10、EQ21"

msgid ""
"Godot provides three equalizers with different numbers of bands, which are "
"represented in the title (6, 10, and 21 bands, respectively). An equalizer "
"on the Master bus can be useful for cutting low and high frequencies that "
"the device's speakers can't reproduce well. For example, phone or tablet "
"speakers usually don't reproduce low frequency sounds well, and could make a "
"limiter or compressor attenuate sounds that aren't even audible to the user "
"anyway."
msgstr ""
"Godot 提供了三种具有不同频段数量的均衡器，其频段数如标题所示（分别为 6、10 "
"和 21 个频段）。主总线上的均衡器可用于截断设备扬声器无法很好地重现的低频和高"
"频声音。例如，手机或平板电脑扬声器通常不能很好地重现低频声音，并且可能使限幅"
"器或压缩器衰减用户根本听不到的声音。"

msgid ""
"Note: The equalizer effect can be disabled when headphones are plugged in, "
"giving the user the best of both worlds."
msgstr "注意：插入耳机时可以禁用均衡器效果，为用户提供两全其美的效果。"

msgid "Filter"
msgstr "过滤器"

msgid ""
"Filter is what all other filters inherit from and should not be used "
"directly."
msgstr "所有其他滤波器都继承自 Filter，不应直接使用。"

msgid "HardLimiter"
msgstr "HardLimiter（硬限幅器）"

msgid ""
"A limiter is similar to a compressor, but it's less flexible and designed to "
"prevent a signal's amplitude exceeding a given dB threshold. Adding a "
"limiter to the final point of the Master bus is good practice, as it offers "
"an easy safeguard against clipping."
msgstr ""
"一种与压缩器类似的限幅器，但灵活性较差，旨在防止信号振幅超过给定的 dB 阈值。"
"在主总线的终点添加一个限幅器是一种很好的做法，因为它提供了一种防止削波的简单"
"保护措施。"

msgid "HighPassFilter"
msgstr "HighPassFilter（高通滤波器）"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency. HighPassFilter is used "
"to reduce the bass content of a signal."
msgstr "截断特定\\ *截断*\\ 频率以下的频率。高通滤波器用于减少信号的低音内容。"

msgid "HighShelfFilter"
msgstr "HighShelfFilter（高架滤波器）"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "减少所有高于特定\\ *截断*\\ 频率的频率。"

msgid "Limiter"
msgstr "Limiter（限幅器）"

msgid ""
"This is the old limiter effect, and it is recommended to use the new "
"HardLimiter effect instead."
msgstr "这是旧的限制器效果，建议改用新的硬限幅器（HardLimiter）效果。"

msgid ""
"Here is an example of how this effect works, if the ceiling is set to -12 "
"dB, and the threshold is 0 dB, all samples going through get reduced by "
"12dB. This changes the waveform of the sound and introduces distortion."
msgstr ""
"以下是该效果的一个例子，如果将上限设置为 -12 dB，阈值为 0 dB，则所有通过的音"
"频样本都会减少 12dB。这会改变音频的波形并引入失真。"

msgid ""
"This effect is being kept to preserve compatibility, however it should be "
"considered deprecated."
msgstr "该效果为了兼容性而保留，但应将其视为已弃用。"

msgid "LowPassFilter"
msgstr "LowPassFilter（低通滤波器）"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency and can also resonate "
"(boost frequencies close to the *Cutoff* frequency). Low pass filters can be "
"used to simulate \"muffled\" sound. For instance, underwater sounds, sounds "
"blocked by walls, or distant sounds."
msgstr ""
"截断特定\\ *截断*\\ 频率以上的频率，也可以产生谐振（增强接近\\ *截断*\\ 频率"
"的频率）。低通滤波器可用于模拟“低沉”的声音。例如，水下的声音、被墙壁阻挡的声"
"音或远处的声音。"

msgid "LowShelfFilter"
msgstr "LowShelfFilter（低架滤波器）"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "降低低于特定\\ *截断*\\ 频率的所有频率。"

msgid "NotchFilter"
msgstr "NotchFilter（陷波滤波器）"

msgid ""
"The opposite of the BandPassFilter, it removes a band of sound from the "
"frequency spectrum at a given *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "与带通滤波器相反，它从给定\\ *截断*\\ 频率的频谱中移除一个声音频段。"

msgid "Panner"
msgstr "Panner（声像）"

msgid ""
"The Panner allows the stereo balance of a signal to be adjusted between the "
"left and right channels. Headphones are recommended when configuring in this "
"effect."
msgstr ""
"声像效果允许在左右通道之间调整信号的立体声平衡。配置该效果时建议使用耳机。"

msgid "Phaser"
msgstr "Phaser（移相器）"

msgid ""
"This effect is formed by de-phasing two duplicates of the same sound so they "
"cancel each other out in an interesting way. Phaser produces a pleasant "
"whooshing sound that moves back and forth through the audio spectrum, and "
"can be a great way to create sci-fi effects or Darth Vader-like voices."
msgstr ""
"这种效果是通过对同一声音的两个副本进行移相而形成的，因此，它们会以一种有趣的"
"方式相互抵消。 移相器会产生令人愉悦的嘶嘶声，在音频频谱中来回移动，如果你要创"
"建科幻风格效果或达斯·维德（Darth Vader）那般的声音，移相器是个好选择。"

msgid "PitchShift"
msgstr "PitchShift（移调）"

msgid ""
"This effect allows the adjustment of the signal's pitch independently of its "
"speed. All frequencies can be increased/decreased with minimal effect on "
"transients. PitchShift can be useful to create unusually high or deep "
"voices. Do note that altering pitch can sound unnatural when pushed outside "
"of a narrow window."
msgstr ""
"这种效果可以独立于速度调整信号的音高。所有频率均可增减，对瞬态的影响极小。"
"PitchShift 可用于创建极其高亢/低沉的声音。需要注意的是，当推到一个狭窄窗口之"
"外时，改变音调可能会听起来不自然。"

msgid "Record"
msgstr "Record（录制）"

msgid "The Record effect allows the user to record sound from a microphone."
msgstr "录音效果允许用户从麦克风录制声音。"

msgid "Reverb"
msgstr "Reverb（混响）"

msgid ""
"Reverb simulates rooms of different sizes. It has adjustable parameters that "
"can be tweaked to obtain the sound of a specific room. Reverb is commonly "
"outputted from :ref:`Area3Ds <class_Area3D>` (see :ref:`Reverb buses "
"<doc_audio_streams_reverb_buses>`), or to apply a \"chamber\" feel to all "
"sounds."
msgstr ""
"混响模拟不同大小的房间。它具有可调节的参数，可以调整这些参数以获得特定房间的"
"声音。混响通常从 :ref:`Area3D <class_Area3D>` 输出（参见《\\ :ref:`混响总线 "

msgid "SpectrumAnalyzer"
msgstr "SpectrumAnalyzer（频谱分析仪）"

msgid ""
"This effect doesn't alter audio, instead, you add this effect to buses you "
"want a spectrum analysis of. This would typically be used for audio "
"visualization. Visualizing voices can be a great way to draw attention to "
"them without just increasing their volume. A demo project using this can be "
"found `here <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/"
"audio/spectrum>`__."
msgstr ""
"这个效果并不会改变音频，相反，你可以把这个效果添加到你想要进行频谱分析的总线"
"上。这通常被用于音频可视化。将声音可视化是一种仅吸引注意力而不增加音量的好方"
"法。使用了这个效果的演示项目可在\\ `这里 <https://github.com/godotengine/"
