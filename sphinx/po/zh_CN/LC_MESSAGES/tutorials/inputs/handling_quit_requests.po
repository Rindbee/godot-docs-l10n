msgid "Handling quit requests"

msgid "Quitting"
msgstr "退出"

"Most platforms have the option to request the application to quit. On "
"desktops, this is usually done with the \"x\" icon on the window title bar. "
"On mobile devices, the app can quit at any time while it is suspended to the "
"background."
msgstr ""
"大多数平台都有要求应用程序退出的选项。在桌面系统中，这通常是通过窗口标题栏上"
"的“x”图标来实现的。在移动设备上，应用程序可以在后台暂停时随时退出。"

msgid "Handling the notification"
msgstr "处理通知"

msgid ""
"On desktop and web platforms, :ref:`Node <class_Node>` receives a special "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` notification when quitting is requested "
"from the window manager."
msgstr ""
"在桌面及 Web 平台上, :ref:`Node <class_Node>` 会在窗口管理器发出退出请求时接"
"受到 ``MainLoop.NOTIFICATION_WM_QUIT_REQUEST`` 通知."

msgid "Handling the notification is done as follows (on any node):"
msgstr "处理通知的方法如下(在任何节点上):"

"It is important to note that by default, Godot apps have the built-in "
"behavior to quit when quit is requested from the window manager. This can be "
"changed, so that the user can take care of the complete quitting procedure:"
msgstr ""
"值得注意的是，默认情况下，当窗口管理器请求退出时，Godot 应用程序具有退出的内"
"置行为。这可以更改，以便用户可以处理完整的退出过程："

msgid "On mobile devices"
msgstr "移动设备"

msgid ""
"There is no direct equivalent to ``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` on mobile "
"platforms. Due to the nature of mobile operating systems, the only place "
"that you can run code prior to quitting is when the app is being suspended "
"to the background. On both Android and iOS, the app can be killed while "
"suspended at any time by either the user or the OS. A way to plan ahead for "
"this possibility is to utilize ``NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_PAUSED`` in order "
"to perform any needed actions as the app is being suspended."
msgstr ""
"移动平台上并没有与 ``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` 等价的东西。由于移动操作"
"系统的特性，退出前运行代码的时机只能是在应用被挂起到后台时。Android 和 iOS 平"
"台上，处于挂起状态的应用随时都可能被用户或操作系统杀死。为了应对这种可能性，"
"一种提前计划的方法是利用 ``NOTIFICATION_APPLICATION_PAUSED`` 在应用程序暂停时"
"执行需要的操作。"

msgid "Sending your own quit notification"
msgstr "发送你自己的退出通知"

msgid ""
"While forcing the application to close can be done by calling :ref:"
"`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>`, doing so will not send the "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` to the nodes in the scene tree. Quitting "
"by calling :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` will not "
"allow custom actions to complete (such as saving, confirming the quit, or "
"debugging), even if you try to delay the line that forces the quit."
msgstr ""
"虽然可以通过调用 :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 来强制关"
"闭应用程序，但这样做不会向节点及场景树发送 "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST``。通过调用 :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 来退出程序会导致自定义动作无法完成（比如保存、"
"确认退出或调试），即使你试图延后执行强制退出的那行代码。"

msgid ""
"Instead, if you want to notify the nodes in the scene tree about the "
"upcoming program termination, you should send the notification yourself:"
msgstr ""
"作为替代，如果你想通知节点以及场景树应用程序即将终止，你应当自己发送对应的通"
"知："

msgid ""
"Sending this notification will inform all nodes about the program "
"termination, but will not terminate the program itself *unlike in 3.X*. In "
"order to achieve the previous behavior, :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` should be called after the notification."
msgstr ""
"如此做将会通知所有的节点应用程序即将终止，但是不会关闭应用程序本身 *（与3.X版"
"本不同）* 。如果需要达到之前的效果，则应当在发送通知后调用 :ref:`SceneTree."
"quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 。"
