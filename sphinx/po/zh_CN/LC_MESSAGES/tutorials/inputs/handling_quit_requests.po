"Most platforms have the option to request the application to quit. On "
"desktops, this is usually done with the \"x\" icon on the window title bar. "
"On Android, the back button is used to quit when on the main screen (and to "
"go back otherwise)."
msgstr ""
"大多数平台都有要求应用程序退出的选项。在桌面系统中，这通常是通过窗口标题栏上"
"的“x”图标来实现的。在 Android 系统上，当在主屏幕上时，后退按钮被用来退出（否"
"则就返回）。"

msgid "Handling the notification"
msgstr "处理通知"

msgid ""
"On desktop and web platforms, :ref:`Node <class_Node>` receives a special "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` notification when quitting is requested "
"from the window manager."
msgstr ""
"在桌面及 Web 平台上, :ref:`Node <class_Node>` 会在窗口管理器发出退出请求时接"
"受到 ``MainLoop.NOTIFICATION_WM_QUIT_REQUEST`` 通知."

msgid ""
"On Android, ``NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` is sent instead. Pressing "
"the Back button will exit the application if **Application > Config > Quit "
"On Go Back** is checked in the Project Settings (which is the default)."
msgstr ""
"在Android系统中, 会发送 ``MainLoop.NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` 代替. 如"
"果在项目设置中勾选了 **Application > Config > Quit On Go Back** (默认), 按"
"Back按钮将退出应用程序."

msgid ""
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` isn't supported on iOS, as iOS devices "
"don't have a physical Back button."
msgstr ""
"``MainLoop.NOTIFICATION_WM_GO_BACK_REQUEST`` 在iOS上不支持, 因为iOS设备没有实"
"体的Back按钮."

msgid "Handling the notification is done as follows (on any node):"
msgstr "处理通知的方法如下(在任何节点上):"

msgid ""
"When developing mobile apps, quitting is not desired unless the user is on "
"the main screen, so the behavior can be changed."
msgstr ""
"在开发移动应用程序时, 除非用户在主屏幕上, 否则不需要退出, 因此处理方式有变化."

"It is important to note that by default, Godot apps have the built-in "
"behavior to quit when quit is requested from the window manager. This can be "
"changed, so that the user can take care of the complete quitting procedure:"
msgstr ""
"值得注意的是, 默认情况下, 在请求退出时,Godot应用程序具有退出的内置行为, 可以"
"更改为:"

msgid "Sending your own quit notification"
msgstr "发送你自己的退出通知"

msgid ""
"While forcing the application to close can be done by calling :ref:"
"`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>`, doing so will not send the "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST`` to the nodes in the scene tree. Quitting "
"by calling :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` will not "
"allow custom actions to complete (such as saving, confirming the quit, or "
"debugging), even if you try to delay the line that forces the quit."
msgstr ""
"虽然可以通过调用 :ref:`SceneTree.quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 来强制关"
"闭应用程序，但这样做不会向节点及场景树发送 "
"``NOTIFICATION_WM_CLOSE_REQUEST``。通过调用 :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 来退出程序会导致自定义动作无法完成（比如保存、"
"确认退出或调试），即使你试图延后执行强制退出的那行代码。"

msgid ""
"Instead, if you want to notify the nodes in the scene tree about the "
"upcoming program termination, you should send the notification yourself:"
msgstr ""
"作为替代，如果你想通知节点以及场景树应用程序即将终止，你应当自己发送对应的通"
"知："

msgid ""
"Sending this notification will inform all nodes about the program "
"termination, but will not terminate the program itself *unlike in 3.X*. In "
"order to achieve the previous behavior, :ref:`SceneTree.quit "
"<class_SceneTree_method_quit>` should be called after the notification."
msgstr ""
"如此做将会通知所有的节点应用程序即将终止，但是不会关闭应用程序本身 *（与3.X版"
"本不同）* 。如果需要达到之前的效果，则应当在发送通知后调用 :ref:`SceneTree."
"quit <class_SceneTree_method_quit>` 。"

msgid "Translation status"
msgstr "翻译状态"
