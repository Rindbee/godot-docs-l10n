"Godot comes with a large set of built-in features. While this is convenient, "
"this also means its binary size is larger than it could be, especially for "
"projects that only use a small portion of its feature set."
msgstr ""
"Godot 内置了大量功能。虽然这很方便，但也意味着其二进制文件体积比实际所需更"
"大，特别是对于仅使用其功能集中一小部分的项目而言。"

"To help reduce binary size, it is possible to compile custom export "
"templates with certain features disabled. This is described in detail "
"in :ref:`doc_optimizing_for_size`. However, determining which features need "
"to be disabled can be a tedious task. The engine compilation configuration "
"editor aims to address this by providing an interface to view and manage "
"these features easily, while also being able to detect the features "
"currently being used in the project."
msgstr ""
"为了帮助减小二进制文件体积，可以编译自定义导出模板，并禁用某些功能。这一点"
"在 :ref:`doc_optimizing_for_size` 中有详细说明。然而，确定哪些功能需要禁用可"

"Unchecking features in this dialog will not reduce binary size directly on "
"export. Since it is only possible to actually remove features from the "

"with the build profile specified to actually benefit from the engine "
"compilation configuration editor."
msgstr ""
"在此对话框中取消勾选功能并不会在导出时直接减小二进制文件体积。由于只有在编译"
