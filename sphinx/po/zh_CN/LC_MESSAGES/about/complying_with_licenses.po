"Godot is created and distributed under the `MIT License <https://"

"and keeps ownership of their contribution."
msgstr ""
"Godot 是根据 `MIT 许可证 <https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>`_\\ 创建并分发"

msgid ""
"The license is the legal requirement for you (or your company) to use and "

"it). Your game or project can have a different license, but it still needs "
"to comply with the original one."
msgstr ""

"法律要求。你的游戏或项目可以具有不同的许可证，但仍需要遵守原始许可证。"

msgid ""

"license information directly from the engine binary, which prevents the "
"information from becoming outdated if you update engine versions."
msgstr ""

"A good option for end users to document third-party licenses is to include "
